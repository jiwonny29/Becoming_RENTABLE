9596,"The apartment was nice and comfortable. Plenty of room for my husband, myself and his mother. The only thing to consider is that the stairs into the apartment are very steep, so be aware if you have young children or elderly. Otherwise it was perfect for our needs. Joyce has put together a nice little spot for her guests. It is central to all of the Seattle hotspots. Definitely would stay here again, if we find ourselves overnighting in Seattle again. Thanks Joyce!!!<br/>","stair, elderly",Negative
25002,"Amanda was an amazing host. She was flexible with our arrival and departure times and even made us some delicious welcome brownies. She provided us with detailed instructions on the available  amenities and everything was as described. Also,the space was wheelchair accessible which was perfect for our family. We would definitely stay again. ","wheelchair, accessible",Positive
210316,"Flor was kind enough to host a friend of mine who was suddenly unemployed due to an illness and yet the disability application was being delayed. So I did not, personally, stay at the house although I paid for the room.<br/>My friend, however, stayed for about a year and found the location to be excellent, particularly for her needs, Flor is friendly and outgoing, the prices are extremely reasonable, the other guests in residence at the time were all courteous and quiet, and everything in the home is kept meticulously clean. This last factor, obviously, became extremely important in March (2020) when the pandemic hit Seattle like a tsunami. Flor immediately stopped taking in new renters and kept her long term guests extra safe and well cared for by adding an extra level of cleaning and some other special loving touches. That?Âs just the kind of host Flor is, she worries about each and every guest and that kind of care shows. <br/>This was just the kind of place my friend needed be to get back on her feet and it happened to be a great place to weather the storm of Covid-19. She is doing so very much better now and I credit a lot of that to Flor?Âs special care and amazing hospitality! <br/>I highly recommend this location, whether you?Âre looking for a room for one night, one week, one month, or even a whole year! <br/>Thank you so much, Flor! You are a spectacular human! ?Â¤Ã¯Â¸Â",disability,Neutral
340706,"Wonderful stay.  Hosts were very organized and informative.  Great neighborhood.  Very relaxed.   Apartment is extremely clean, well furnished, modern and comfortable.   Lots of amenities -- washer dryer, children's high chair and pack and play, books, television with netflix and apple tv........   There are some steps up to the front of the house and then steps down into the apartment for those who are elderly or avoid stairs.","stair, step, elderly",Negative
365550,"Our schedules didn't coincide enough to be able to meet Dirk & Jaq, but we had plentiful email communication before and after our stay and they were accommodating and communicative throughout. The place worked fine for our needs, a bit funky in all the best ways, with a loft, artsy backdrop, shared bathroom (though there are two, both spacious) and heart-of-downtown location. Had a kind of hip European vibe, which we enjoyed quite a bit.
<br/>
<br/>Great location next to the ballpark and a gob of restaurants & bars; 20 minutes or so walk to Pike's Market. It being downtown, parking is a bit tricky, but manageable if you pay attention and have decent city wiles. Wouldn't recommend the elderly or infirm (or severely-under-the-influence) climbing the ladder to the loft, but for all other comers, it's a great spot at a very fair price. We would return!","elderly, spacious",Negative
565703,What a wonderful home! More spacious than I expected. Exactly as described. A huge bonus for us was how effortless it was to access with a wheelchair. Lots of places within easy walking distance.  I can?Ât say enough! We loved our stay!?Â¤Ã¯Â¸Â,"wheelchair, spacious",Positive
793629,"About the house:<br/>The house is conveniently located minutes from down town. If downtown is where you are going to be spending your time then this is a great house to check in to. <br/>It is cozy, and fit me and my wife comfortably. Though there wasn't enough storage in the bedroom for our luggage (1 large 2 small) so we just had them out on the floor next to the bed. The entire house was clean and organized. The bathroom had extra toiletries which was great, even though we didn't have to use them. The only details that weren't convenient were that it was always a struggle to get the bedroom door closed, and that the only way to get to the house was a steep set of stairs (this would make it very hard for someone in a wheelchair or with a physical disability to access the house.<br/>Location:<br/>The location of the house is great. There is a grocery store within walking distance and a few coffee shops as well. And if you don't feel like driving downtown and paying $10-$30 on parking there are a some good places to eat close by. Our favorite is a Mexican food truck called Taqueria El Asador. Being Mexican myself i can assure you this is authentic mexican food. Some of the streets get cramped if there are cars parked on both sides so they sometimes become one way streets and we needed to be careful when driving down them.<br/>Our stay here was just what we had hoped for. We definitely recommend it to a single or a couple wanting a place to stay while visiting Seattle. Thank you Candace!","wheelchair, stair, ramp, disability, large",Negative
1000883,"What you will find: a welcoming host, a beautiful place to stay, and one of the more accessible (as a wheelchair user who travels with a care provider) places I've stayed while traveling! Thank you! Note: bathroom dimensions necessitate parking wheelchair just outside bathroom door.","wheelchair, accessible",Positive
1246769,"For two visitors on vacation from the UK this flat has the perfect downtown location - a few minutes walk from the central shopping area, and 20 minutes walk from Pikes Place, with the monorail station (to access the expo area) no more than 10 minutes away.<br/>Access arrangements worked perfectly.  The flat was beautifully clean and more than adequately equipped for our 3 day stay.  The bed was comfortable and the lounge with large TV was relaxing.<br/>The noise of traffic on the freeway nearby was to be expected and the price you pay for the great location.<br/>Good to have the use of a visitors' parking permit, as parking police are VERY vigilant - we were given a $450 fine within minutes of arriving, our fault for parking in a confusing disabled parking area outside the flat!  Thankfully we spotted the ticket being slapped on the windscreen from the window and ran down and persuaded the kind policeman to take pity on us!  From then on we found (with difficulty at times) spaces within 10 minutes walk of the flat.<br/>We'd be more than happy to return if in Seattle again.  Thank you to Jaq and Dirk for their prompt replies and use of their beautiful property.","disabled, large",Neutral
1351716,"The cottage is just as described.   Tidy and comfortable.   My GPS somehow led me astray, but I sent a message on Airbnb's site and got a nearly instantaneous response from Bill.  He stood out on the curb to guide me to a convenient parking space on the street. Then he kindly assisted me with carrying my bags  to the rental's entrance.   There are 4 or 5 steps up from the street and another few  up to the cottage door,  so not wheelchair accessible but that wasn't an issue for me.   The location is very convenient for exploring Seattle, a  Lyft driver showed up within 5 minutes of my request so I didn't have to worry about downtown parking.   Bed was comfortable,  plenty of space to stretch out and relax.  Perfect for a home away from home experience in the city.","wheelchair, step, accessible",Negative
2026794,"Our host Sheryl was very welcoming and provided everything we needed. (Plus a couple of small things we forgot to pack.) The room is just as shown in the listing, and the neighborhood is calm, quiet, pedestrian friendly, and close to several bus lines. Sheryl asked about our interests in Seattle, then researched those things and provided us with lots of information and options that allowed us to maximize our time in Seattle. In particular, she discovered a couple of promotional events surrounding the soccer game we came to see, so we got to participate in two events that we didn't know about. That worked out superbly! She also provided great public transportation info, along with advice on how to use the buses efficiently. And she found us some very nice money-saving deals on tourist activities. The house was built a long time ago, and it has various long-term renovation projects underway. As shown in the photo, there is a tall stairway to the front door and there are two turns in the stairs to the bedrooms. For this reason, Sheryl's rooms are not ideal for someone who is elderly or has physical disabilities. Our visit couldn't have been much better, and we really appreciated having our room for such a reasonable price in such a convenient location. We definitely recommend Sheryl's cozy cottage!","stair, elderly",Negative
2760312,"The place is very nice, tastefully decorated and very clean. The shower in particular was a joy - instant-on hot water and two shower heads. It was great. <br/>I?Âd heard there was a gym, but didn?Ât see it. Wouldn?Ât have had a chance to use it if I had. <br/>Be aware that you have to ascend/descend a rather steep inside staircase to get to the property. For people with a disability or heavy luggage, it might be an issue. <br/>Overall, a lovely property.","stair, disability",Negative
3379116,"This was our first airbnb experience and it couldn't have been more perfect!  We loved the carriage house! The location was perfect, the entire carriage house was immaculate and Jill has thought of everything a guest could possibly need! Laundry soap, dryer sheets, shampoo, conditioner, lotion, iron, books, games and so much more!<br/>Even though we only live across the Puget Sound from Seattle we needed a place in Seattle proper for our daughters wedding weekend of festivities.  We had 2 of our son's and their wife/girlfriend staying with us from out of state. Jill let us check in early and was very responsive to all communication throughout. <br/>The house is right by the freeway so it is a bit noisy but that is city living. Jill provides sound machines and ear plugs (none of us needed them).  It's is beautifully decorated and bigger than it looks in the pictures. <br/>The parking is street parking and can be a bit difficult to find an open spot at times. However we never had to park more than a block away. If you have elderly or disabled people in a group you can pull into the alley right in front of the door to drop off and pick them up.<br/>We had many family members come and hang out with us at various times in the 4 days we were there. Everyone fell in love with it.<br/>It was a wonderful experience and we highly recommend this place and Jill!","disabled, elderly, big",Positive
4100009,"I stayed here with my mother and grandmother while visiting my brother.  We found the space to be simply furnished with all the essentials.  We found the space cute, inviting and comfortable.  The host was friendly and accommodating where possible - quick to respond/answer questions.  The location was perfect for us - close to where we were going.  We felt the unit was very fairly priced.  There is no dedicated parking (slight inconvenience for my disabled mother and elderly grandmother) but I found no trouble finding street parking within a 1 to 2 block radius.  We would have liked to have a TV for mornings/late night, but really appreciated the shareable laundry room.","disabled, elderly",Negative
4881141,"Easy Uber ride to the best local beach area! I have mobility issues and while this would not be the place to stay if you were in a wheelchair, it was fine for me. There are some stairs to navigate, but I think most houses in the area would be the same. You do need to be able to climb a few stairs and walking to the beach isn?Ât impossible, the walk back up the hill is very steep! Uber is ready, available and cheap! ","wheelchair, stair",Negative
4956314,"Fern is a great and responsive host. She made my partner and I feel super welcome and even went so far as to accommodate around my partner?Âs disability. Save for some sound traveling from upstairs during the day (this is a basement after all) the space was quiet, peaceful and just what we needed for a quick visit to Seattle without actually being in the thick of it.","stair, disability",Positive
5362889,"Great place! My parents are new to Airbnb and showed up pretty early, but the host was so kind and accommodating. The place was cute, comfortable, and clean! Comfy beds (one of the most important aspects for me) and soft bedding. Bathroom and kitchen floors were clean, as were tubs and sinks. The location is great, the base of the space needle is maybe 2 blocks away. Lots of restaurants in walking distance (and that's walking distance for a disabled person, which is huge!). Stay here with confidence.","disabled, tub",Positive
6101613,"It was a good space and a good place for my family to meet stay while we did activities around Seattle. I would have to say it's nothing super special, but it nicely housed the number of people as advertised and had space for us to have dinner and hang out a little.<br/>Not a great place if you have people who might not be fully ambulatory (elderly who walks with cane assistance for example) due to stairs, tight parking, furniture that is very low and hard to get out of.","stair, elderly",Negative
6245498,"It was great!  The house is older but it?Âs got some classic charm. My only complaint would be in the bathroom.  The toilet is very low to the ground, my husband is slightly disabled and could not get up on his own. Too low.",disabled,Negative
6438518,"We had a short two night stay for a wedding in Woodland Park.  The design and furnishings are nicely done with high end finishes.   The couch is comfortable (albeit not long enough for a nap).  The bedrooms are well separated for privacy.  The mattresses seem new and we slept well.  <br/><br/>Even though this is a basement conversion the windows provide sufficient light and cross ventilation.  It doesn't feel like a basement.  <br/><br/>The location is perfect.  We walked to breakfast and lunch on Fremont and had a nice time reading in the rose garden just across the street (free).  There is a gas station just down the street and easy access to the freeway.  I have a disability and can't walk very far, otherwise it would have been great to go through the park over to Green Lake. <br/><br/>Parking is on the street.  We found places right in front most of the time.  ",disability,Neutral
6438518,"This is a great place to stay long or short term. This basement apartment was in a great location in Seattle. Aurora Ave is a main road and this home is located just a couple blocks away. There is a market just a couple blocks away. It?Âs right next door to one of the Zoo entrances. Door access was convenient and it was nice not having to carry a key around. The back yard where you enter is beautiful, lots of flowers and a nice place to relax outside.<br/>Street parking was only option but worked out fine. A lot of free parking on Sundays for other attractions too. <br/>Front room was comfortable, along with the 2 beds and pillows. Seating only has enough for 3 people, unless you use the 2 kitchen chairs as well, which are on the smaller side. <br/>Bathroom is spacious and the water pressure was great!! There is no A/C and we expected the weather to be around high 70s and it ended up being in the high 90s, so that part was rough!<br/>I am 6 feet tall and had a rough time with the height of the ceilings and the mirrors. <br/>Overall the host was wonderful, very communicative and helpful. My daughter is disabled and while the door entry was a tight squeeze she was able to get down easily and get around great! Thank you!","disabled, spacious",Positive

6991188,"Ron's place is located in an awesome neigborhood that is scenic, quiet and is in close proximity to all the major buses. The flat is beautiful and well-maintained, and maintains a cozy, welcoming appearance for all new guests. Ron provides useful household items in order to make your stay comfortable and relaxing. He is also very helpful with any questions you may have about the flat or the city.<br/>The main bedroom contains a smart TV that allows you to enjoy YouTube or Netflix, as well as other networks. The bed was comfortable and large enough for two guests. The bathroom has a washer and dryer, which is extremely useful for tourists. Ron also has all the cleaning and hygiene supplies you will ever need, which saved us money and time. Overall, this flat is spacious and creates a positive atmosphere.<br/>Other comments and concerns: the flat is located on the second floor and contains steps that lead to the entrance, so if you have heavy/multiple luggages and/or a disability, it may be difficult to carry your items to and from the flat. If that is not a concern to you, please disregard the comment. In addition, the lock to the door is a bit confusing and caused us some issues when he had first arrived (these locks are not used everywhere), but Ron will be there to assist you in case of any problems or confusion. <br/>Overall, our trip was very relaxing and welcomed us to the city of Seattle. We suggest to anyone visiting the beautiful city to stay at this flat.","step, disability, large, spacious, tub",Negative
6991188,"Ron has a spacious and clean flat as advertised. He was an excellent host and welcoming. He met us when we arrived, showed us the place, and answered all of our questions about the area.

7275464,It was amazing staying at Bobby?Âs place after getting away from an unsafe housing situation due to mold. I have a lot of allergies due to illness and my body felt really good in the space. <br/>Bobby was incredibly helpful and accommodating. I have an invisible disability and often I have to get things delivered and cook most of my own food. Bobby was very helpful with this and let me know when packages came as well as letting me use his freezer and space heater. Very responsive as well.,disability,Positive
7349029,"The space was easy to access with directions being given by Ron in advance.  The private entry and privacy was nice, although, at times it felt less than private.  Particularly during a Friday night party that was held in the main home. There was a lot of noise well past the designated ""quiet hours"" for guests.  We had a long, busy day of site seeing and simply wanted to watch a Netflix movie and relax that evening.  The party made that impossible.  Everything else about the space was what we expected. The driveway has quite an incline though and persons with any kind of disability would have trouble with it.  ",disability,Negative
7871885,"This was a cozy mother-in-Law cottage in the back of a beautiful home in a beautiful neighborhood, with plenty of free street parking. However, if you have a disability, the entry probably wouldn?Ât be convenient as there are stairs and a narrow path into the back yard. <br/>The unit itself is basically an efficiency apartment with a small bathroom and queen sized bed. This set up was all my partner and I needed, being that we spent most of our days venturing about town. <br/>The unit was clean with all of the amenities you would need such as a refrigerator, dishes, a closet, towels, and a handy basket of toiletries. <br/>The only flaw about this unit is the temperature regulation. The unit gets hot and the fan doesn?Ât do much to cool the unit. Plus, the fan has a slight rattle in the night. So, if you?Âre a light sleeper you might find the noise bothersome. <br/>In all, I very much enjoyed my stay.","stair, disability",Negative

8780358,"Bo and Regina?Âs space is lovely. The apartment is part of a much larger home and is in a quiet neighborhood. Parking is available all along the street which is nice. The gas fireplace is also a nice touch, especially in winter. We also appreciated the private entrance, however the lighting at night wasn?Ât great and if you have any sort of disability, the stairs might be a challenge. The other thing to note is this is a family with 3 young children and a dog, so it would be recommended that you have earplugs handy, not to mention the for the garbage trucks early in the morning. If that?Âs not a problem for you, I would recommend staying. They are very responsive with questions and concerns.

10263907,"We really enjoyed how the place was set up. It was like having our own little apartment hotel! It was especially helpful to have a guaranteed parking spot. In Seattle that's something not very common. Being disabled, that's very important, plus it's often raining and not all areas of Seattle is it safe to leave your vehicle when it's full. We felt very safe there! I was impressed with the attention to detail. It was exactly like the photos, very clean, and quiet and cozy. The bed was actually pretty comfy, too! We only stayed the one night and were not there for exploring. We had a Comic Convention to go to for a day, so it was a rather quick trip, but I would highly recommend this place!",disabled,Positive

12573882,"This is a Karen y'all. I didn't feel welcome or safe staying with Sabina-- Airbnb agreed and helped me cancel the booking. <br/>When I booked, I specifically mentioned I would bring my certified service dog. Airbnb's policy does not require guests do this, but I did it out of respect. She didn't respond with any welcome msg. I had to follow up 48 hrs before my arrival and she replied by giving me grief for bringing a ""pet"". I told her that by the ADA regulations and Airbnb's policy, a service dog is not considered a pet. She then rudely insinuated I would be unable to prove I need a service dog. I replied with the several tasks that my dog performs for me, but given her tone and clear discomfort with us staying, offered that she could cancel our reservation. She then insisted that my disabilities were not disabilities but refused to cancel the reservation on her end because she wanted my cancellation charges. <br/>It is absolutely unacceptable she thinks she has the right to judge anyone's disabilities. The ADA is federal law that defines what a disability is and it certainly isn't within one random Karen's purview to decide what qualifies as a disability. How could anyone possibly feel comfortable staying there after this host's horrible and inhospitable attitude? <br/>Airbnb is supposed to be about community, but she's clearly more interested in profit than actually being a welcoming host.",disability,Negative

But when I arrived, (on time, just after 3) the door was open, and there were items in the walkway. There was no response when I said hello, so my guest and I continued on with the check-in process and left for our event. Soon after, I received a message from Alexis saying that she thought we were intruders since we didn't announce our arrival. We never received any notice that she'd be on her way out at our check-in time. She also didn't make an attempt at welcoming us as guests in her home. She chalked it up to our safety as a traveling woman and said we shouldn't have checked in without notifying her. Even though we followed the instructions exactly.

15885497,"This place was great for our quick overnight in Seattle! The availability of feee road parking was wonderful. The road the home is located on is quite steep, which did make it a tad more challenging but not too bothersome. <br/>If you have mobility issues this is NOT the place for you as the sidewalks and stairs are uneven. Also, the interior floor is quite hard so bring a pair of indoor shoes or slippers. <br/>The bedroom was comfortable and clean and we slept very well. <br/>While not disturbing, we did notice thumps and bumps and the occasional loud yell during day hours.

15929975,"This place was way better than what we expected. It was a very modern home which came with all the amenities . The hostess was quick to respond to our inquiries. <br/>We came during spring break and weather was a bit cold so it was nice to come back to a beautiful, clean, and cozy place after a long day of visiting colleges with my kids and turn on the fireplace while we relaxed.<br/>They also provided a basket of goodies including 2 bottles of red and wine , freshly baked cookies , lollipops , popcorn , Nutella and fruits . The place came stocked with coffee/tea, eggs , muffins, butter , and basic cooking ingredients.<br/> Everything was nicely labeled throughout the house and they had a binder of laminated information of things to do in Seattle and places to eat  much like a resort hotel. <br/>The drive was about 25 minutes to downtown Seattle. The place was a short distance to ferry landing.<br/>I look forward to staying at this place in the summer so my family and can sit outside enjoy the view of Puget Sound or take a ferry. <br/>The only issue I had was the cleaning fee of $150 for entire stay was a bit high considering we were asked to remove all the pillow cases and duvets off the comforter ourselves and asked to throw the garbage outside . We also gathered all the towels and placed them in the hamper, cleaned and wipe down the place . <br/>Note for disabled : There are 2 entrances to the place . You have to drop off your family /luggage?Âs on the back part of the house and then come back down to front of  the house to park your car .

16218478,"The location is right around the corner from a bus stop that can go to a nearby light rail station (to get to the airport) or Pike place. It's about 7-8 blocks from the Broadway area, which is a really nice area with good restaurants, bars, a nice park and thrift shops and alternative clothing stores. Very queer friendly.<br/>Tri is very accommodating and responsive and offers a wonderful apartment. It's secure, though as it is at the top of 2 flights of stairs and at the end of the hallway, it's not very accessible if someone has a disability. This wasn't an issue for us, but I wanted to state it for anyone needing to know. The furniture is nice (Ikea) and functional. The apartment is simple and uncluttered, with plenty of space for storing luggage. The kitchen is tight, so maybe not best for someone who intends to do a lot of cooking, but perfectly fine for basic breakfasts or making coffee/tea or what have you. The couch is super comfy (pulls out), and I'm told the bed was good too.<br/>The apartment is in a neighborhood with some life at night. Normal for a city (I think), especially on the weekends, but was a bit much for one of my more noise-sensitive friends. I slept through it. The nightlife is only a few blocks away, completely within walking distance at night. <br/>Overall a great stay! Highly recommend.","stair, disability, accessible",Negative

Only heads up to families with strollers or anyone in wheelchair is that there are a few steps (4-5 steps) to climb up on to get to the front door, we didn't see a ramp anywhere (not a big deal with a stroller, but may be a bigger issue with a wheelchair).

The place was very clean and cozy and my parents reported that the bed was very comfortable. No A/C (standard for thid part tof the country) but the windows and subterranean level of the place left us comfortably cool enough. Liang's dog would bark when we entered (as described) but only for a sec (good watch dog!) :) The only trouble we had was due to my dad's poor eyesight... The pathway to the side where you enter is a bit uneven -- as is every sidewalk in the city, I quickly came to notice-- so elderly or disabled guests may need to be cautious, esp in the dark. Overall a great value in such a cute neighborhood.","disabled, elderly",Negative

Also, the room was listed as wheelchair accessible with a large bathroom entrance and zero step entryway, but the bathroom was not large enough for a wheelchair. The entrance to the apartment required a small 2-3 inch step, a steep ramp, and having to traverse both grass and gravel which would be difficult for other wheelchair users.","wheelchair, step, ramp, accessible, large",Negative

The host gave clear check in info, was responsive prior to my arrival & offered himself available in communicating & told me to let him know if there was anything missing, however I really hoped to find a space that didn't have any major issues because I was traveling for business and didn't have a lot of time to communicate back & forth. There was maintenance issues (shower wasn't working properly when I got there & I couldn't shower - had to use another space next door until it was fixed) & the wifi was unstable as well as a very sensitive smoke alarm that went off every time I cooked that made my stay stressful as someone with a disability. For folks who are wanting a fully equipped kitchen to prepare food, this space has some cooking supplies but the minimum; some things were missing to make it possible to prepare full meals. Host was generally responsive, dropped off later on.",disability,Neutral

There were no issues with booking my stay and I was able to get accommodations with guests.<br/>The Airbnb is smaller than it appears in the photos. The fold-out couch takes up the entire living room when open so there is no room to move about. The bathroom is very small and awkward. Guests may find it difficult to move about the bathroom and to sit comfortably on the toilet. For reference, I was rather uncomfortable as a slim, 5??tall woman. There?Âs a step down from the kitchen into the mudroom and bathroom so I wouldn?Ât recommend this place for anyone that disabled, tall, or large. <br/>The kitchen has good amenities, however, there is no door between the kitchen and living room. Guests may find it difficult to sleep in the living room due to the nosiness of the creaky wardrobe and nearby washer/dryer. <br/>The location was great and the neighborhood is rather quiet. Overall, my stay was fine but I personally wouldn?Ât rebook here for the price.","step, disabled, large",Negative

Its within walking distance of the lake. We didn't have a vehicle to park but there is parking up front and around the back side, however it is first come first serve. They have internet which makes it great if you are taking a trip out there for work etc. They have air conditioning which was GREAT for us since it was unseasonably warm when we arrived.

There are no steps, the shower is a step-in, stand up, the bathroom has enough room to work with a wheelchair. The kitchen had EVERYTHING we needed.

About a mile from UVILLAGE, a wonderful place to shop, eat or just walk. Internet worked fine. The beds are incredibly comfortable. The neighbors are quiet and really nice. Walkable to stores, parks, libraries and bookstores. Has umbrellas to borrow and even some books to read. Private backyard. <br/>The not so good, but not bad; the stairs are steep, so if you have a person with a disability traveling with you, keep in mind.

35381715,"Hello everyone,<br/>Magic was very effective and efficient when responding to my needs, very appreciated. If you aren't familiar with traveling and don't understand what a loft is, be ready to climb up a ladder to sleep on the bed provided because it is on the second ""level"" of the loft. So if you have a disability that impairs you from walking than this is not the place for you because there isn't an elevator to reach the floor that you are staying at. Parking is extremely limited so don't expect to find parking because you need a zone 7 permit and you won't receive one. So you have to park 5-6 blocks away from the loft. We found parking far away over night and it was free after 10:00 p.m. and you had to move it by the morning before 8:00 a.m.  READ THE SIGNS because we were given a citation.<br/>Other than those inconveniences, it was a great experience. It was extremely close to downtown with an Uber or a rental car (5-10 minutes away) and the place was clean. Overall, I would rate my experience a 4/5. Thank you.","elevator, disability",Negative

It had everything from spare pillows (a major must for me), to snacks (great for med takers), and even shower steamers (we've always wanted to try them). Also, the added bonus of keeping our luggage on site after our official checkout cannot be understated. Lynn went above and beyond to ensure our needs were met and had great local recommendations and clear transit instructions. Some caveats: As Advertised, this is not the Airbnb for tall folks nor for the physically disabled. However, Lynn and Tim are just as welcoming of folks from all walks of life speaking as a Queer POC, I felt welcomed and at home. 12/10 we are definitely booking them and their beautiful Garden again on our next visit to Seattle.",disabled,Negative

Yet you are a short drive from everywhere.<br/>- Value is excellent. Very good price for two actual bedrooms and 1.5 baths.<br/>- Cleanliness is excellent. The places was spotless.<br/>- Communication. The host is quick to respond and very helpful<br/>- Each bedroom, common area, and bath have their own individually controlled heaters.<br/>The Good.<br/>- Beds were comfortable. Not he best I've slept on at Airbnb's, and the sheets were just average, but I slept well.<br/>- Kitchen had most items you would need<br/>- Furniture was eclectic and fairly comfortable.<br/>The Unfortunate, Unusual, or Items to Note<br/>- You need to climb several stairs to enter. This was no issue for my wife and I (fit at 60) but if you are disabled or not fit you might find this an issue.<br/>- I was stunned that at any Airbnb, and particularly one in Seattle, there was no coffee maker. There was a teapot, and (gasp) instant coffee. I have never been in an Airbnb without a coffee pot. I can only assume that the owner is not a coffee drinker. We bought a pour-over unit at starbucks. I cannot begin a morning without fresh coffee. And never Instant.<br/>- Entry is easy with a code but you MUST remember to lock with a code when you leave. It does not auto lock.<br/>- There were plenty of towels but no washcloths <br/>- There were no tissues<br/>- The half bath had a sink but no mirror. <br/>- The 2nd bedroom had no mirror<br/>In summary this was an excellent place at a fair price.

39818131,"Easy access was one of the main reasons I chose this place to stay because I am disabled and elderly. I saw there were no stairs at the entry. Exceptionally clean. The space has only one window. It is in the bedroom so it is a dark basement space. The overhead lighting is very bright. There are a few issues that were addressed. Some could not be addressed but future guests should know what they are. Addressed:  no bath mat in a slippery tub. They brought one as soon as I mentioned it.  Other safety and accessibility issues need to be mentioned but cannot be addressed. Since the ceilings are low, the furniture is unusually low so getting up from the sofa and bed is difficult. The table wobbles and turns, presenting a potential fall risk.  If laundry is offered, it should be accessible. There was their laundry in the machines and the overhead light was unreachable. I had to use the flashlight in my phone to figure how to use the machines. Very awkward because of the clutter in the laundry room and entryway. There was a lot of their stuff to deal with on the floor and laundry space.  The bath rug outside of the tub is a minuscule 12 inches by 12 inches and is slippery.  No bathroom glass but owners were kind enough to give me a plastic cup from Starbucks.  I never did meet the owners.  Their rules state quiet time after 10. They hosted a gathering of friends that lasted until 11 pm and since there is no soundproofing, I could not go to bed due to the noise. If you are sensitive to mold, this is not the place for you.  There was mold on the shower curtain liner. There was no heater or de-humidifier to ameliorate the damp cold. . There were two air cleaners, tho. It?Âs in a great location. Nice and quiet.  Advertised as a luxury dwelling, my overall feeling is that it is not, but with minor adjustments, most of the issues mentioned would bring it up to standard.

Complete with the slightly off level of the floors.  The beautiful soaking bathtub was lovely.  It should be noted my husband is in a wheelchair and his shower chair fit just fine in the tub.  <br/>My husband's wheelchair worked just fine throughout the unit.  However the opening to the bathroom is smaller than his wheelchair (which is extra wide) so he just needed to step through the door. There is a raised entrance to the kitchen so he had to back into the kitchen in his wheelchair.   Both bedrooms were spacious so he was able to maneuver inside the bedrooms  well.<br/>The beds were wonderful.   What a surprise to fine one bed had an adjustable base!!!!   That was worth the 5 star rating all on its own.<br/>Although we didn't go downtown it was easily accessible!  We did take a the opportunity to go visit Bruce Lee's graveside which is just minutes away.<br/>We would love to come back and stay again.<br/>On a personal note I had the opportunity to meet Chris.

Failed to mention that the property is very inaccessible by public transit, making it hard for my disabled partner to access. Bed was almost definitely not a queen as advertised. <br/>Cleanliness of the Airbnb was yet another concerning aspect of the property. Cleaning happened infrequently enough that it got to the point that the kitchen trash and recycle, bathroom trash, and towel laundry were all overflowing, all the clean towels were dirty, and the toilet was clogged, and it still took us sending them a message to get anything actually done.

48447536,"Craig is my idea of the ideal host; everything is impeccable & he has the communication down pat; there was a welcome note on the door & a more detailed one in the room covering everything we might need to know. The room is small but well-appointed & has all you need. There were fresh flowers, the linens were lovely, the garden is great. Craig is thoughtful & accommodating, but offers privacy for his guests. It would be difficult for a disabled person to navigate, but just from the curb to the door. Inside it is all on one level. Nice quiet residential street. A very convenient area if you like being out of the urban center but 10 minutes away from the University & 15 from downtown. Great value!",disabled,Positive

It was user with a disability inability versus the oven not working. Julie was generous and offered to help. If you struggle with appliances - I highly suggest asking ahead for a tutorial when you check in to avoid issue.",disability,Neutral
49800930,"I would absolutely recommend staying at the Panama. You get what you see. It?Âs a beautiful, old, historic building where most things are just as they were in 1910. As a solo traveling college student the location was phenomenal and the staff was all wonderful. I love antique places and am used to roughing it camping and staying in old lake cottages so i didn?Ât at all mind some of the things others  may call drawbacks. You really feel the familial aspect of the business as everyone seems to know each other and are very friendly. The Panama Coffee and Tea next door was an unexpected highlight for me and a great way to start each morning. Jan is incredible and so helpful and I met a ton of very cool people who frequent the hotel and cafe. <br/>THINGS TO NOTE! <br/>- It?Âs on a hill and the stairs going in are steep so if you are handicapped and/or disabled it?Âs something to be aware of <br/>- I recommend buying a big water bottle when you?Âre out as I didn?Ât love the idea of drinking from the tap with such old pipes<br/>- My biggest (and only real) complaint is the outlets in the bedrooms. There was one 2-prong outlet and the lamp chord and my phone cord were ALWAYS falling out. Unless you have an adapter there?Âs no way to charge w a 3-prong laptop charger.","stair, handicapped, disabled, big",Negative

50703198,"Seattle can be very cold in the winter months--a wet cold--and often the older homes there don't have good heat.  So I chose this home because it had central air and carpeted bedrooms and it was wonderful, I stayed cozy and warm all day and night.  It was quiet, easy to find, and well-equipped.  All three bedrooms are very close to each other, one bedroom has an attached bath.   Beds were comfortable, water pressure was good, and everything was really clean.  Everything is low to the ground and wide for wheelchair accessibility, even the ""peep hole"" on the front door is lower for those in a chair.  I enjoyed my stay here very much.",wheelchair,Positive

Incredible view and location super easy drive from airport and very near downtown (although Seattle traffic isn?Ât fun). We enjoyed use of the kitchen which was a great set up had everything we needed and more.  We sat on the deck and watched the sunset.  We used the grill. We walked to a local restaurant and another day walked to the ferry an d took it to Vashon.  There?Âs a Safeway nearby and multiple shops and restaurants within an easy drive. If you are disabled or elderly or unsteady this home is extremely well set up to be easy to get around.  I agree with the review that said they wished they had had more time here.  We did too.  A couple more days and we would have watched more awesome sunsets, perhaps paddle boarded and certainly would have hoped to get to know Rose and James better.

51125043,"Everything was good, the bedroom, the living area, fully equipped kitchen (coffee beans, nespresso machine, french press), bathroom/rain/pulsating shower and laundry/dryer.  The things I don?Ât like is the really tight car parking spot (in front of the house main entrance which is locked/inaccessible) but street parking is available.  The only accessible back entrance to the house for airbnb renters is a narrow stone pathway (about 4 feet wide) downhill for about 80 feet.  Struggled to hand carry luggages down and up this narrow pathway.  It will be a challenge for the elderlies and those with physical disability.  The house was not easy to find either, avoid checking in when dark outside.","disability, accessible",Negative

Everything was clean and the bus around the corner was perfect.  Vince had good tips for us that helped us.  I didn't think parking on the ""hill"" was bad, since you have space on the right when you park out again.  We were glad that it wasn't that hot, as the heat in the apartment is already very high (despite mobile air conditioning).  Unfortunately the hair dryer disabled the fuse so we didn't want to use it anymore.  The bathroom in the master bedroom is very small so a shelf and hooks would be nice to put some things away.  Basically it was a nice stay, even if the price is very high in summer.",disabled,Neutral

52368417,"This place is amazing. It's even nicer than the pictures. I would definitely recommend staying here. <br/>The layout is: a foyer with small mudroom when you first enter, then it opens up to a large open concept area with a great kitchen, dining room, and living room with tons of windows that give you an awesome view of the sound. There are 2 bedrooms with a bathroom in between. There is also a huge deck.<br/>The space worked out very well for my dad and sister who were visiting me but unfortunately couldn't stay with me at my house. When I booked the place I was initially hesitant about noise because I noticed that there is another unit underneath this one. But it was not a problem at all -- I didn't hear a peep and I didn't feel like we needed to tiptoe around, either (hopefully we weren't too loud, haha). <br/>Easy street parking and there are a lot of shops/amenities within a very quick drive or 10-15 min walk. <br/>Lastly, the host was incredibly kind and understanding of my detailed questions about the layout (I wanted to make sure my disabled dad would be able to navigate).","disabled, large",Positive
52417453,"Love this place, I would stay here again. Things to consider: The check in process was very difficult. They ask you for your ID -not sure why if I?Âm verified through Airbnb. I had to send them a picture of my ID 3 times for them to accept it - every time they would say that there?Âs a glare or they can?Ât see it, or??or?? After I got there, everything was wonderful. There are no elevators but staff is willing to help carry your luggage to your room. If you have a disability you should make sure you get a room on the ground floor. The rooms are small but clean - I stayed there alone but if I stayed with someone we would have had a problem. The shower is next to the door and covered by clear glass. People in the room can see you showering. There?Âs a fridge but no microwave. The coffee machine is great but you have to ask from more coffee from the staff that work there that are there only in the mornings. Parking on the street is free from 8pm-8am but you have to be lucky to find a place to park - other times, theres a 2 hour limit. The garage next to the place is $15 a day with multiple entrances and exit. You have to have your car out by 7 am or you?Âll get a $30 ticket. SMFH. The area is <br/>great! Lots of good restaurants and mama?Âs pizza is amazing. If you?Âre okay with all of that this would be a great place for you!","elevator, disability",Negative
52423852,"Blair, was nice&responsive. Mattresses and pillows were great. Home is spacious and heating system is solid. But there were issues with maintenance & cleanliness, that we would not book here again. We made due, but the property pictured isn't quite an accurate depiction of what we got,&it needs a deep clean: particularly the floors, mold in the kitchen, bathroom,&in the washer. We have a disabled person in our group and we note the furniture available in listings so we book places accessible for them. The inaccurate photos, changes in furniture, insecure hand rail on the stairs&limited wifi made leisure time together hard. In our 1 wk stay, we did have to have a maintenance person come by for the washer/dryer, a plumber was expected to come by to work on a leak, & the host's friends keep their van in the garage, so they also had to come by to get their van.

53991600,"Recommended. Brand new townhouse in a great neighborhood. Free parking spot. Lots of lovely daylight and long views to downtown. New building going up across the alley blocks some of the view but it's still pretty darn great. <br/>We had no problems with the construction across the alley, but we were out and about most days. Maybe not the right place for late sleepers until that's finished. I'd guess it needs a few more months, into Fall 2023. <br/>Equipped with a nice kitchen for cooking breakfasts etc. Dishwasher! Nice bathrooms. In-house laundry was great. AC was helpful. Soft mattresses on the beds may or may not suit you -- I found them uncomfortable but it's a matter of taste I suppose. Lots of stairs, so not well suited to folks who are elderly or disabled. <br/>If you want a clean, modern place with lots of amenities a block away from restaurants and cafes in the heart of Seattle, this fits the bill!","stair, disabled, elderly",Negative

There were plenty of comfortable pillows and extra blankets, and both beds were very firm. <br/>It wasn't a problem for us, but in case you have kids or are disabled, there are a lot of stairs in the condo.

This neighborhood is a densely populated area and there's scarcely enough parking space for everybody. After renting my car and being fined for violating parking regulations (although I had carefully paid attention to any posted signs nearby to avoid violation of parking, I still got fined!), I had to give up, returned the rented car, and switched to hailing Uber instead.

There were more than enough towels but we could?Âve used more pillows and blankets. Our issues with the property were that a fireplace and 2 parking stalls were specified in the amenities but the owner did not want us to use the fireplace and parked a van in one of the stalls for our entire stay. Our Vacasa host was responsive but needed to ask the owner, who wasn?Ât as responsive, about each of our our inquiries, which took time. If the owner can honor the listed amenities, this is a worthwhile rental.","disability, accessible",Positive

Would highly recommend for anyone that needs an accessible home.","wheelchair, accessible",Positive
9.69674E+17,"At first arrival, the property practically looked abandoned with the overgrown yard and weeds. Once inside, there was a definite dog urine smell and there was a broken chair with a tiny note placed on the seat saying ""out of order"". Before we had a chance to explain to the children and my disabled husband that the chair was broken, they both were caught sitting in the chair with 3 legs. Luckily no one was hurt. The backyard was extremely overgrown and had dog poop in it. Granted the previous renter had not done their part cleaning up after their pet(s)  but it was not a place for children to play. After preparing a quick meal after driving 6 hours, we found the garbage disposal wasn't working and the sink clogged immediately. Then looking for the coffee pot to prepare coffee for the next morning, we found a coffeemaker with a handle for a  carafe but nothing more.  I quickly reported this dilemma. Later we found tucked in a corner a tiny motel room coffee maker that basically makes 2 cups of coffee. Not exceptable for a 6 person lodging. After dinner, I ran a small bag of trash out to find the trash container completely full. Then, in the main bathroom, there was a safety issue of a screw sticking out of the wall at least an inch near where you enter & exit the bathtub. The bathroom sink would not drain unless you held the stopper up with your fingers. There was no dish soap or laundry detergent. There were crumbs in a kitchen drawer. A mishmash of old pots/pans & lids. The refrigerator door is loose and has to be tugged on to open. The half bath toilet is continuously flowing a bit. <br/>The bathtub was slippery and we did appreciate Scott bringing a bathmat for safety. Also appreciate him bringing a new coffeemaker, detergent and soap, but the fact that I had to call and report these deficiencies and safety issues,  and the inconvenience of all of the above, at the extremely overpriced rate left my family and me feeling less than satisfied with this poorly maintained property. <br/>My family and I have rented many properties and this was by far the worst experience and truthfully I feel we are due a refund for our trouble and disappointment.","disabled, tub",Negative

1.04884E+18,"Chela was an amazing hostess! My mom and I arrived to Seattle at 6am and she allowed us early check in which was extremely kind. She was so extremely hospitable. The only two downsides are that 1. although there is A/C listed in the listing, it's only in the upstairs where the hostess lives and is not accessible to the guests and 2. the stairs leading to the listing in the backyard made it difficult for walking with heavy luggages and is not disability friendly. Truthfullyyy, you can hear the hosts upstairs but you can tell that they try their best to stay very quiet, mainly just walking around. Other than that, the listing was very clean, easy to find, and we felt safe the entire time. Chela was extremely accommodating and communicative. She is also very understanding and asks for feedback as it is a fresh airbnb.

Parking was easy and I think this is a convenient location if you have a car to get around. Very comfortable bed, furniture, and linens and everything was clean. There are dogs that you can hear sometimes but they are so cute and I didn?Ât mind it and sometimes it was nice to say hi to them. WFH and looking out the window bird watching was so lovely.

Location was fantastic! Close to Downtown San Diego and the Harbor front. Plenty of freeway access to get to other cities along the coast. The property manager was very attentive and made sure we had everything we needed. Last but not least, the ADA accommodations were great! Handicap parking space, ramp access, accessible showers and tubs with handles. The only thing I would highlight is the shower chair wasn?t entirely trustworthy. A little too small to be a seat but nonetheless it was a very comfortable space for my husband who is in a wheelchair. We used a different chair for a shower chair and all was good!

Within .1 miles are a small grocery, liquor store, coffee shop and 4 restaurants. My parents loved evening sitting on the patio conversing with locals that passed by. Mission beach has free beach motor chairs for disabled people. Just call to reserve. Also I rented a wheelchair for the week from a local place for less than 70$ with pickup and delivery. We ordered essentials delivered by Von's within 3 hours for a 6-7$ fee. This place is expensive, but you are paying for privacy. Just sit on your patio and watch your kids play on the beach.

It's not often that you get three bathrooms with three bedrooms, so we jumped at the opportunity to stay here. It's more comfortable and home-like when you don't have to share bathroom space. The kitchen was huge and we loved being able to cook the occasional meal and store all of our snacky, in-between meal food. The beds were comfortable and the TVs were programmed to accept logins to the majority of available streaming services, which was fantastic. Customer service was excellent! The only real downside was the location of the apartment, which is on a busy road with lots of traffic noise. Also,  parking spots are too narrow; there was an SUV parked in the spot adjacent to ours for most of the stay and there was no way that our SUV would fit between it and the car on the other side.

587158173461757231,"We traveled to Nashville over the weekend for a trip with our 2 year old and grandparents. Location and communication from the property managers was excellent. The managers consistently updated us and sent checkout instructions well in advance. The checkin process was very easy. The property is very well equipped and is very clean.<br/>However, there are some issues that we faced. There are 20 units and 20 parking spots, 2 of them are handicapped only. Even though the property rental agreement says that there is only one parking spot per unit, there is no way to enforce it. There is no parking sticker and no one at the property to ensure that this rule is being followed. We had trouble finding a spot inside the property, though there is plenty of street parking available. <br/>The other issue that people should be aware of is very poor sound proofing. We could hear very clearly even routine conversations in the adjacent unit. They turned on some music till 3 AM and we were unable to sleep well because of the noise. I do not think that it was loud volume, but it was very much audible as if we were playing TV in our unit. Further, we could clearly hear loud footsteps from people walking in the unit upstairs and our 2 year old woke up startled when the people upstairs woke up and walked around in the middle of the night, presumably to use the restroom. <br/>Hence, even though this is a well maintained property at a very convenient location, people should be aware of these fundamental issues and book accordingly.

Nice list of recs for dining, etc. Neighborhood was ok but I probably wouldn't not have gone for a run around the area by myself.

I was so excited that her Nashville unit became available at the last minute for me and my husband. Her place is located in such a great neighborhood that is a mature and well established area of Nashville.  So close to both Opryland, airport and minutes from downtown/Broadway etc.  I felt like I was in my own neighborhood. It is quiet but so close to tons of restaurants, grocery, interstate and basically everything you would need within a couple of miles. I even went to yoga that was about 2 miles away.  The unit itself is so cute??huge?¦and has every comfort of home. Everything was so clean with great design elements, furniture, linens, decor and more!! Also for anyone who has mobility issues or wheelchair bound, this place is perfect.

577434926565879835,"The views are gorgeous but unfortunately views don?t make up for unprofessionalism, dirty floors and blood stained sheets. I reached out ahead of time letting them know we would be traveling with a disabled child and his service animal. They originally said he was welcome and on day 2 I received an aggressive phone call saying my card couldn?t be charged a pet fee and they had no record of my email. Luckily I did and sent screenshots. Staff emailed me and called me rude after upsetting me regarding the treatment of my child?s service animal. The garage is also frustrating. We were charged $40 every time we exited and a random $20. We were there for 42 hours and billed $130+ for the garage that was supposed to be $40/24hrs.

565143230373064984,"Overall, I enjoyed my stay in Nashville! The unit itself is a very nice, spacious one bedroom apartment, great for any small family/ single who is traveling. <br/>Pros: <br/>- clean, modern apartment. Nice kitchen, spacious bathroom. The unit matches the photos and is very pleasant. <br/>- located about a mile from broadway street/ downtown( if that?s your thing). <br/>- great air conditioning unit<br/>Cons: <br/>- no laundry in the unit or building. For longer stays this becomes a problem, I unfortunately had to spend a decent amount of time at a laundromat, which is about 3 miles away. <br/>- while the location is close to downtown, it?s located in a slightly rough area. Very poorly lit at night and not heavily trafficked. <br/>- very unlikely to be any on site staff. Cleaning crews yes, but any other assistance will require a phone call/ text. Normally not an issue, however this company uses electronic locks, which expire nightly. I took my dog to use the bathroom at 1:30 in the morning and my ?latch link??expired at some point while I was out. I was locked out of my unit for 35 minutes while waiting to get support on the phone. Thankfully I was in the building, but had I been outside, I would have been locked out in a poorly lit area in the middle of the night. I?ll say that again, I had my phone with me, I knew my code, but my link expired as didn?t refresh until the next morning, so I was essentially just waiting for support to get back to me, in the middle of the night. Always have your phone with you when there are electronic latches, but even that sometimes won?t be enough. <br/>- On my 2nd to last night I took my dog out to use the restroom around 11:30 pm, and there was a very strange man there roaming the halls. He was dressed as a security guard, and mentioned he was such, the minute he saw me he started talking my ear off about his mental disability and that he had recently been evicted in Virginia less than two weeks before. In my stay prior I hadn?t ever encountered him, and was very thrown off by the interaction. <br/>- on my last day, a police officer showed up to the building and was attempting to gain access( but couldn?t without a code). We started chatting and while he didn?t tell me why he was there, he seemed very perplexed about the nature of the building/ occupants( all Airbnb units). <br/>Overall I would probably look to book elsewhere on my return to Nashville. While the unit itself is very nice, it didn?t make up for the issues/ oddities encountered. Further, I?d argue overpriced for what you end up getting.",disability,Negative

54227245,"Really nice place.  Only things I?d want to note is the apartment we got was on a third level with only stair access and I didn?t recall seeing that listed so that could be an issue for those who are disabled or with mobility problems.  Also, when we arrived, the pull out bed linens and pillows were tossed at the bottom of the living room closet on the floor, so it was hard to say if they were clean.  Otherwise the apartment was lovely and well furnished.  Everything worked as expected.  The bed was extremely comfortable, like I want to know what that mattress is.  Note: the lot next door is building so there is constant construction noise, that?s not the fault of this proprietor, but it does make sleeping in difficult.  This place was a 15 min walk from Midtown and the two closest Old Town Trolley stops.",disabled,Neutral

You will have to do a lot of up and down, not handicap friendly. There are no cleaning supplies, we had a little incident taking the groceries up the stairs and spilled a 2L coke bottle.

53973132,"I want to begin this review by saying that I had asked this host to reschedule due to my mother being unwell. I even offered to rebook at another time that would have meant paying more money. The host waited a day to respond only to say a flat no, claiming they were a ""family business"" with bills to pay. They only cared about not refunding our money, putting profit ahead of people. Because the trip was my mother's idea, she felt obligated to go even though she was unwell. So, this host forced an elderly, unwell woman to go on a trip that she was not up to OR lose her hard earned $800. And while on the trip, her health continued to decline. Unfortunately, a ""family business"" does not appear to translate to ""family values."" <br/>While this was not the best start, I had hoped we'd enjoy ourselves and be glad we made the trip. No such luck. <br/>While I agree that the decor inside is very modern, and the location is good/close to many sites, I found this location to be underwhelming at best. While we booked at a discounted rate, the normal rate is very high. It's definitely too high for what you get. <br/>While the inside is hip and fashionable, it's not as comfortable as you imagine it to be in the photos. It's on a major road, and traffic can be heard in the front bedroom all night long. The kitchen is small, and the dishwasher latch was broken (when I texted the host, she said ""oh sorry, the latch sticks."" For these prices, I expect fully useable appliances). Also, the TV is a smart TV, but it's not set up, and the password was not made available. The front bedroom was also insanely tiny; we barely fit our luggage and ourselves in there.  I do not see how 8 people could stay in this condo; it felt tiny with four. <br/>Finally, regarding the cleaning fee, I felt I did too much cleaning before I left. For $100, I should not be stripping my own bed, washing linens, and doing the dishes. That's no longer a vacation. <br/>The host told me multiple times ""we're not a hotel."" I agree; they're not, and we deeply regret not booking a hotel. In fact, this may be the Airbnb experience that takes us back to hotels exclusively. <br/>I encourage these hosts to care less about hip decor and hoarding profits and more about what people - their customers - actually want and need: empathy, comfort, working appliances, and reasonable fees/policies.",elderly,Negative

51366091,"What an amazing place! It was close to so may awesome places in East Nashville and an easy jaunt to Broadway and the downtown Nashville attractions. <br/>Bedrooms on the first floor were great for the elderly members of our group.

50814177,Allen was available when needed which wasnt much. Property fit the description. Great roof top for relaxing and cigar smoking. Kithchen fully stocked. Lots of space for the 8 of us. we all had BEDS which sometimes for our Mancation is an issue. Overall would return. Only thing is this property is not fit for handicapped or physically challenged as there are a few stairs that could be an issue. OVERALL we loved the property!  Would highly recommend it. <br/>Close to everything in downtown area.,handicap,Neutral
50805506,"This house is simply amazing. Perfect for a large group or girls trip. Each room has its own full bathroom. The Dolly Mural is perfect for photos as well as the rooftop sign. Home had all the necessities needed as if you were back home. <br/>Uber-Lyft rides are approx 15 mins away from downtown. We were a large group so XL Uber?s were $30 to $50 (depending on time of day) but split among 4-5 people. <br/>Please note this house is multiple levels. Meaning first level is garage and one bedroom. And then second level is kitchen, living room, another bedroom and bathroom. Third level is master bedroom and bunk bedroom. And fourth level is the rooftop. That?s 3 flights of stairs so keep that in mind with small children, elderly or out of shape people like myself lol<br/>Chris was only a call-text away. he responded to any concern we had and offered solution promptly.",elderly,Negative

50769417,"The house is just as listed. Perfect amount of of space for a large group. Matt is VERY quick to respond to questions. We ran into an issuewhen we arrived and he sent someone over within the hour to fix the issue.  The house is within minutes of EVERYTHING and after doing everything the house is perfect! I have to add because this is So important to me...I couldn't hear the neighbors and I'm sure they couldn't here us (we had a baby that has healthy lungs).  If you are coming to Nashville and need a house for a girls get away, Batchelor's party, big family get together ...this is your house! If your bringing someone that has bad knees or is elderly...maybe not...lots & lots of stairs :)",elderly,Negative

50440855,"This place is as beautiful as the pictures. (however I there is construction directly next to the home as of January 2023) We had three families; 5 kids under 12 and 6 adults. We were able to enjoy time together and still have our own space. Most new builds in this area are multi-story, and having the elevator allowed for us to spend time together on multiple floors even with handicapped family members. You can expect all the bells and whistles here including great sound systems on the deck, phenomenal shower in the master, and game areas throughout. This home has all the amenities for a fun bachelorette or friends party where you are eating out every meal. If you are planning on being in more and cooking, plan on bringing most items needed. There are plenty of plates, cups, serving pieces, and utensils-just not much else (like additional trash bags or soap, paper towels, etc.)<br/>We had a great time. The location was great-about 10 min from downtown!",handicap,Positive
50363289,"The place was nice and very spacious.  Everything was pretty clean with the exception of the walls which could use some TLC.  The house was great for a large group of young people as there was plenty of room and 3 bathrooms for everyone to get ready in.  The only drawbacks were that the house smelled of pot when we arrived, which was unexpected in a non-smoking house, nothing was done by the host to rectify the problem when they were informed.  Additionally, the wi-fi never worked well enough to actually use the TV so that was disappointing.   Other than that be prepared for a lot of steps to get to all bedrooms.  So if you are older or handicapped this wouldn?t be the place for you.",handicap,Negative
50136696,"I?d like to start off by thanking you for the opportunity to be able to have our family together in one place for our annual Thanksgiving trip. With that being said, we were utterly disappointed with almost every aspect of the property. Right away, we were met with multiple safety hazards that were very concerning giving the fact we had small children and 2 disabled adults. First was the living room rug. It was ripped and curled up causing a major trip hazard. The handrail to the rooftop was also ripped from the wall and very unstable. Also causing a major concern for the children and adults that rely on that handrail. There was also black mold and peeling drywall in the bedroom on the main floor where 2 children were sleeping. That is unacceptable. Please contact for further details and additional issues and concerns. To include, damaged and filthy furniture, floors, bedding etc. pictures also available",disabled,Negative
50103650,"Overall the stay was fine, however there are a few things to note that I wish I would?ve known. Considering this was the most expensive Airbnb available I thought the pictures would be accurate and I would be able to impress my family who was coming in from out of town.. aren?t you supposed to get what you pay for?.. not the case. <br/>We ultimately chose this home because there was an awesome rooftop with cornhole and tons of seating. Upon arrival there was in fact no cornhole and only one small seating area. The hanging lights only half worked (ghetto). The rooftop has absolutely no view of the city. To say we were let down would be an understatement. <br/>This condo is setup with a tonnnn of stairs. There are so many levels that it made simply walking from one area to another very inconvenient. We had some elderly guests with us and some guests with knee and back trouble. It was simply impossible for them to get from the bottom floor bedroom to the kitchen/living space which was I believe on the 4th floor. <br/>Around 11pm we get a knock on the door. Metro police. Wanting us to know that the area is known for break ins so to be sure our cars were locked up. <br/>I would most definitely not rebook this property.",elderly,Negative
50051904,"I got a text 40 minutes before check in that our place was unavailable. We were not given follow up until I had to call and repeatedly ask where we were going to stay, if parking would be transferred, etc. Representatives were evasive of any questions or giving details on important things like this. I had chosen the location because I had to walk to a training that week, so a place farther away meant finding transport because it was too far and too long of a walk to make it to the training by 8 am every day without waking up at an an unreasonable hour. Had to keep asking about accommodations because of traveling with my disabled parents, and kept getting evasive answers. Ended up not knowing where to navigate to until well after check in. When asking these simple questions and sharing why we chose the location, the rep kept talking and loudly ?mhmm?ing over me instead of listening and/or responding to questions. So unprofessional on so many levels. Also, the unit was poorly maintained.",disabled,Negative
49880977,"The most accurately described Airbnb I've ever stayed at... My only ""complaint"" (as I'm disabled)is that if you park in the closest spots, you walk up 3 flights of stairs. If you park further away, you walk up 2 flights of stairs, but have to walk around the whole complex to get to the condo, which is next to the other flight of stairs. (Stairs are mentioned in the description.)<br/>This condo very comfortably sleeps only 2 (as stated in the description). Although the space is smaller, every inch of it is used appropriately, the kitchen is well-stocked (bring your own creamer) and it's impeccably cleaned. It's also beautifully decorated and cozy.<br/>The location cannot be beat. Within 5 min of all Vandy campuses. A large Publix & restaurants & shops in walking distance. If you have trouble choosing, your friendly hosts have suggestions! They recommended MLRose for burgers & we ended up enjoying their burgers, pretzel bites & skillet cookie daily.<br/>All in all, great hosts & a fantastic space!!",disabled,Negative
49797253,Nice older home that has some decent updates. Host group was responsive to 3 immediate needs we reported that made our stay better...sent maintenence person within a couple of hours. I think during winter they should at least leave 1 light on inside the home so it is not pitch black upon arrival. This home is not handicap accessible  which we needed somewhat but luckily we had three young men family to assist our elderly parents that had a hard time with the steps into house. If you are looking for really quiet that wont be as you hear lots of road noise late into the night and early into the morning..of course not hosts fault but its a busy street. there is a hospital nearby too so you get a lot of sirens as well. Bathroom tub downstairs was really spongy which made me feel uneasy but i just used the one upstairs. I did let them know about this and they were responsive and I feel they will address. Older home so floors are really creeky especially upstairs. Would stay again!,"handicap, elderly",Negative

49568650,"Hubby and I recently stayed here with my elderly relatives and had a great experience.  The house is huge, very clean and looks exactly like the pictures.  It also sits on a beautiful piece of property that is very private.  Too bad we were so busy that we didn't get to enjoy the outside.  We did, however, have a great time with the ping pong table.  It was a short drive to get to everything we wanted.  One tip:  park in the Library parking lot if you are downtown.  Its reasonably priced and they will validate some of the time.  A lot less expensive than the other lots.",elderly,Positive
49516319,This was a great location in Nashville. A nice neighborhood and walkable to downtown.

49516167,"Best Airbnb I've ever stayed at! The photos are EXACT to the location! <br/>This unit easily sleeps a party of 10 with 4 bedrooms and couch space. The entire home was extremely clean and the first floor was wheelchair accessible. <br/>As far as an early check in time, Sonder was extremely accommodating. I submitted a request and had access to a member of their team 7 days a week 24 hours a day. They are truly on top of everything and make your stay absolutely perfect.<br/>The location is perfect. You are a 5 minute uber drive to downtown ($10 roughly each ride), and walking distance from incredible restaurants, pubs, and coffeeshops. VERY SAFE!<br/>The kitchen / dining room is gorgeous! Fully stocked shelves with all the silverware and utensils you'd need! And IF you run out, there are 2 dish washers connected to the island. There is also a big refrigerator / freezer, microwave, and oven in the event you feel like staying in for a meal.<br/>I would definitely stay here again!!",wheelchair,Positive
49516167,"5 of us stayed 4 nights in this airy, spacious and fine accommodation in Germantown which is a lovely, quiet area close enough to all the action.  For those who have no health or physical issues, you could make the walk to downtown.<br/>Please note...we were not warned at time of booking that there is only one bedroom on the main floor. Three are on a second floor with a very narrow and very steep 18 step staircase.  <br/>This important ""feature"" should most certainly have been noted in the details before booking.  <br/>Plus there are also several steps required to reach the main door of the unit.  The two of us who could not handle steps had to be driven up Taylor Street to the back of the units where we could get in without steps.  <br/>That is a very important something that should be included in the details and Sonder needs to be honest about such negatives.<br/>So we two disabled persons could not use or even see any of those upper bedrooms.  Fortunately there was one sole bedroom on first floor and one old and very uncomfortable sofa bed which has seen better days for sure.  Sonder.... It's time for a replacement!!! <br/>We found the kitchen & refrigerator to be sparsely equipped for us because we intended to cook breakfast each morning and dinner one night.  We went to Kroeger to buy all the condiments as well as coffee and some utensils.  The kitchen needs regular soup bowls and another large mixing bowl.  We made do with one fry pan & one mixing bowl but one or two more would have been helpful, as well as one or two more dish towels. <br/>The bathrooms are clean & roomy but there is only one towel bar and only one hook on the wall. Really!  And only one little bar of soap so we purchased a few more at Kroeger.<br/>The shower stalls should most definitely have a grab bar because the stone floor is flat, smooth & slippery requiring us to lay a towel down to avoid accidents.  <br/>We also had to lay a towel down on floor outside the shower stalls to soak up the water from the showerhead (which is high up on the ceiling) which flowed out onto the floor.  Another slip hazzard.<br/>Read the small print....there  is no TV although it is mentioned  in their ""amenities"".  You need to get an app!  There is no cable service.<br/>Aside from the important safety issues and other details mentioned in this review, this is a fine place to stay in Nashville.",disabled,Negative
49339531,"DIRTY; No sofa linens; no pool towels; given 4 bath towels, 1 hand towel, 1 bathmat (0 washcloths); used chat system for sofa linens & received them late 1st night. Sofa had poo stains; every single towel that we DID have, had at least 1 stain on it. Put in a handicap room for some reason so the little floor towel does not absorb the MASSIVE amount of water that comes from the make-shift shower (mounted adjustable showerhead on a pole) w/ a curtain that doesn't reach the floor. Water gets EVERYWHERE.

An extreme amount of stairs which one of my guests was elderly. The primary bed and bunk beds were comfortable however, the two rear beds and two queen beds were FIRM. No use of fireplace.

48655479,"Chris was extremely responsive and timely. Check-in was easy and the close out instructions were clear. The location is very convenient and the in-house game room was a big bonus! Plenty of towels were available and the updated appliances made the visit very comfortable. <br/>The ?Where You?ll Sleep??section could be clarified a bit; though the pictures were very accurate. The bedroom on the first floor is very small which made it difficult to sleep 6 comfortably, as implied. The 2nd bedroom has a queen bed and two single/bunk beds. The third single bed listed in that bedroom is actually a foam mattress housed in the closet. Similarly, the single specified in the 3rd bedroom with the 2 king beds is actually a rollaway cot, also stored in the closet.<br/>The 4th bedroom (main floor) contains a daybed and trundle, but the wall/door that conceals it prevents you from using the trundle for anyone larger than a small child. That bedroom leads to a 1/2 bath and has no window coverings, so it is hard to rest, privately.<br/>Persons with severe pet allergies should notice the ?pets allowed??section of a listing. I missed that and my nephew suffered because of the pet residue from previous visitors. There was pet hair in the sofa, in two of the carpets and in the bed of one of the bedrooms. Chris responded expeditiously, however, and remedied the problem first thing the next morning. It took the housekeeper quite a while to get it all cleaned up, but her diligence made the rest of the stay much more comfortable for us.<br/>The parking limitations are not conducive for groups. Only one vehicle is allowed at the complex, which makes loading/unloading a little inconvenient. Off-site parking is near by, but most days, we had to park almost a block or more away from the residence. <br/>Finally, as beautiful as this home is, it is not handicap-accessible. Our family members with physical disabilities had to make other arrangements upon arrival.",handicap,Positive

They offer us to leave and refund 1/2 money if we left second day but unfortunately we had no choice to stay due to my disability and not able to find another place to stay due to CMA festival. <br/>They did send someone to spray/fix problem. They came but problem got worst We thought because they sent someone out it would solve the issue but as noted it got worst. Supposedly they are shutting unit down. So be aware. <br/>And if you see white powder (as a few other noted) that?s for their bug problems (and don?t work). <br/>The place has a few wear and tear - Toilet paper holder falls off while using, door looks like someone tried to break in, sofa is not a sofa bed it?s a fancy looking futon and hard as a rock and patio is misleading (you can?t sit outside on it FYI).",disability,Negative

I Loved the Airbnb itself, I wish I lived there haha. It was clean, spacious, convenient, and the view is an added plus.

Our driver was usually at the front gate by the time we got there!  There is private parking.  The house had some stained furniture in the living room, but nothing unexpected.  The kitchen was well-equipped.  There are a lot of stairs, so that should be a consideration for any elderly or physically challenged folks.  The neighborhood is a city/suburban area that appears to be up and coming.  It's very quiet, and we didn't even see a single neighbor in the complex.

There is only one bathroom and with a group of seven was a little difficult,  also only one tv in the house, and being handicap was a little difficult getting up and down the stairs. only recommendation I would say would be the beds were to firm for some of my family . but over all great house great host great experience",handicap,Neutral
46194921,"DeRon's place was a lovely place to stay. The home was extremely spacious, clean and cozy. It had all the amenities our group needed to feel at home. The location is a short Uber or drive away for most areas in Nashville. It is close to a train track which can be a little loud when the train is coming through so I'd recommend a pair of earbuds for lighter sleepers. The hot tub on the roof top was perfect. We felt like we were in a safe area and appreciated having the security guard for weekend nights. There's a lot of stairs so it wouldn't be wheelchair accessible and need to be careful with luggage, but the layout is great otherwise.",wheelchair,Negative
45844196,"We stayed here for my sister in law's 50th birthday.  Overall the place was great, beds confortable, and it was very clean.  It also had 2 kitchens.  The area surrounding the condo is sketchy but the condo is gated so that helps.  There was also a security guard outside the gate on the Saturday night which was a nice surprise.   Parts of the condo were worn  (some walls and cabinets with scratches) but that happens with rentals.  Overall it was a nice condo.  The kitchen had plates, knives, paper towel, pots and pans and glasses but did not have pot holders, whisks, napkins, or measuring cups.  Front right burner on 2nd floor kitchen did not work.  Bathrooms had plenty of towels & soap (nice surprise) & toilet paper but no kleenex.  We were okay with the amount of steps but if you have older people or handicapped this place will not work for you.  The host was very attentive and quick to respond.  I recommend if you stay here that you hire a driver (which we did) to ensure your safety.",handicap,Neutral
45816243,This place was just okay. The pictures did not match the place exactly.

A bit pricey for the area and the noise.,clear path,Negative

Any questions we had, he helped resolve quickly. <br/>It was GREAT to have THREE bathrooms, 4 bedrooms, and a bonus room that was separate from the rest of the house.

First floor (living room, dining area, kitchen, 1/2 bath). Upstairs (3 bedrooms, 2 full bathrooms, laundry area. Check in was really easy using door code. You can enter from the front or the rear of the house (we mostly used the rear). I had a few elderly/mobility impaired folks who visited during my stay. They were able to navigate the one step at the rear of the house for easy entry and exit. There was always available street parking at the front of the house and there are 2 dedicated parking spaces at the rear entrance of the house.

44461617,"Ingrid was a fantastic host and I really enjoyed my stay at the end of January! There for a conference at the Gaylord Opryland and location was a short, convenient, less than 15-minute drive. Access to downtown is also a short drive. IMO, this was a great location to be able to visit both. Nearby highway access. I was surprised by easy and light traffic (at least compared to Chicago and suburbs).<br/>The basement unit under the deck was easy to access from the parking spot at end of the driveway. A bit of a pitch to it, but even backing in was made easier by markers placed there. Be mindful that the owner?s cars are also in the driveway, but they are parked to the side leaving a clear path in and out.<br/>The unit is perfect for one or two guests to have a comfortable, cozy stay. Small kitchenette has toaster oven, microwave, and mini fridge. Good for leftovers and small groceries from nearby Kroger. Bonus having washer and dryer, too.<br/>Loved my stay and would do it again!

Other than that, great!",handicap,Positive
43930556,"The unit was not clean. Refrigerator was gross. Host offered $30 on a $130 cleaning fee that clearly was not utilized on my stay. Pet hair/human hair was everywhere... in the bed/bed linens, on couch, even in the refrigerator. Even had a few bug visitors. Pictures and video taken of the rental. My worst AirBNB experience ever. Very disappointing as this was a staycation get together for my family for the holidays. Super embarrassed. My last rental was Villa Esprit in the Cayman Islands, so I rent very nice, elaborate units. This one just missed the mark. To add insult to injury, the host had the nerve to imply I created the problem.  As if I yanked out hairs to place in her nasty refrigerator. Checked out early and enjoyed Christmas in the comfort of my own 4 bedroom home, where it's clean to my standards, and should done in the first place.  I was trying to create an out of town vibe without traveling with my elderly parents due to Covid. Never again.",elderly,Negative

The river is just yards away from the deck.  It?s in a safe neighborhood.  Easy access to all the fun in Nashville and close and convenient to the airport.  We cooked & ate inside most nights.  A grocery store is very close. The apartment was VERY clean.  Beds were really comfortable.  Friendly neighborhood cats visit on the deck.

43435645,"I loved this space! It felt like an Airbnb, but very homey. The walls are kind of dinged up from past renters, but nothing some paint couldn't fix. It's directly above bartaco which means you can hear their music until it stops at about 9 BUT you can't hear the music at ALL in the bedroom, so it doesn't impact sleep. There is construction on the lot to the north which goes from 7am-4pm. Kind of a bummer if you want to sleep in, but not the end of the world. Kitchen had two pans, three cutting boards, some cooking utensils, and plates/flatware. If you want a bottle opener, pots, etc. you'll want to bring your own. All in all a great place and would totally stay again. Not wheelchair friendly.",wheelchair,Neutral

Mas Tacos across the street is AMAZING (try the elote!). Gas station being right there is convenient too.<br/>The only things of note that I would recommend are:<br/>- bring your own pillow if you can. The pillows as of 10/14/22-10/16/22 are a little rough on your neck.<br/>- if you need handicap accessible parking, this is not the place for you. It is a very tight fit and large vehicles will give you little to no room for moving down the driveway once parked in it.

43139150,Comfy stay . Got a lot of exercise walking up and down the stairs but I needed it. Wouldn?t recommend it to parents with toddlers or elderly because of all the stairs but this is most definitely the place to stay with older children and big families . The place seems very safe it was 10-20 mins away from the area we were traveling back and forth too. The whole house location and decor was above top tier . The house is decorated beautifully.

The only issue I had was the rigorous cleaning instructions when I also paid a $125 cleaning fee. -_- The other thing to note is that the floor is uneven going from the living room to the kitchen so everyone kept tripping.

There is plenty of seating inside and outside and it was very enjoyable to simply relax in the house and on the deck with cold drinks. The kitchen had everything we needed to make brunches and family style dinners. We got good pizza one night from Angelo?s Picnic Pizza which was a short drive away and we got groceries from Kroger which is a very short drive away. We chose this house because it was close to the lake and hiking (10min drive through neighborhood areas) and really enjoyed our active mornings out of the house.

There was an abundance of dust and dirt everywhere, hair left in the showers, fingerprints and smudge marks on the windows, and etc. the dust was so bad that my elderly family members had to stay in hotels.

41649194,I would like to say that this was the worst experience I have ever had in my life while travelling. My car was broken into the windows were smashed for an attempted theft. Bad bad neighbourhood I?m surprised Abode is choosing to run an Airbnb there in the first place. The car next to ours was also an Airbnb guest and their car was broken into as well. A loaded weapon was stolen from that car so I would fear for anyone who would be staying in that place. It is not only unsafe for belongings but for our lives itself. Apart from the safety the apartment was not as pictured. There was a strange smell which lingered in the apartment despite opening the windows for a while. Additionally the sink was clogged and the water would drain extremely slowly.<br/>On calling Abode all I was given was a party line stating it has been escalated to the leadership and there was no other response. We requested a late check out so we could figure out a way to get the car repaired and continue on our road trip and they said they would ?consider??it and disabled the access codes for the apartment so we were stranded with luggage and no place to go for at least an hour. <br/>I would strongly urge everyone to please stay elsewhere or even cancel already made bookings given safety concerns and suboptimal support and maintenance.,disabled,Negative

41173021,"The loft is gorgeous and super convenient location wise. The communication, check-in/out instructions were great and I loved the binder of local suggestions. <br/>However, this wasn?t my favorite stay. Apart from the convenient location, you have to have a smartphone to park. They don?t tell you that until you receive your check in information. Make sure to scan the QR code in the lot first because otherwise you?ll be taking a trip back downstairs to do so. I appreciate the validation, parking runs about $11 for 24 hours with it but it?s not user friendly as the website that services the parking is faulty. I paid for 24 hours and somehow had a ticket on my windshield the next morning which resulted in having to call customer service to get it resolved. No biggie and not UrbanNashville?s fault, just a hassle I didn?t want to spend 25 minutes handling, but they did end up removing the fines. Secondly, this listing came up under a search for handicap accessibility, when we arrived the ground floor elevator wouldn?t open. You had to use the first floor. My mother who has trouble walking had to take the stairs to the door one level up, which was a struggle especially with trying to carry bags and other items while making sure she didn?t fall. There are only 6 steps but they are steep and it rained pretty heavily during part of our stay. Lastly, and it?s trivial, but I don?t understand why some of these rental companies provide the cheapest of toilet paper and toiletries - but they do so pack your own. It would?ve been nice for those listed amenities to have been as nice as the aesthetic and location of the rental. <br/>This location is perfect for a quick bachelorette trip or something of the like but be mindful when taking people who have handicaps.",handicap,Positive

Kelli keeps the place absolutely immaculate and everything is shiny and new. The location couldn't be better--super close to great East Nash spots as well as to supermarkets on Gallatin--but tucked away on a lovely side street so it's nice and quiet. Laundry is located in Kelli's home but that was no problem. There's a separate entrance for the machines and the family is great about unlocking the door and granting generous access. In fact, Kelli and her family were generous about everything. They provided two folding tables so we could use them as desks (one also doubled as a dinner table since there's only a breakfast bar). Plus, Kelli happily offered to lend us any kitchen equipment we might have needed during our long stay. That wasn't even necessary, since the kitchen--while pint-sized--had everything we needed, from a sweet little dishwasher to sparkling clean dishware and pans to measuring cups and spoons to rimmed baking sheets to full coffee and tea service. My only heddzup? The second bedroom is located up a windy little staircase (see picture). Probably not great for the elderly or very young. But that wasn't an issue for us.

Parking during my stay was easy; but I can see where it could be difficult if during a busier time. The only negative I have to add about this room is the shower head/water pressure is pitiful. Combine this with an open air shower (no door and only a partial glass wall), you will not have the most pleasant showering experience. Other than this, I?d give it a 4/5 stars. Pets are welcome which a bonus for us. Beware there is no elevator and your room could be on the second floor which requires walking up two flights of steps. If you have heavy luggage, a dog crate/kennel be mindful. I wouldn?t consider this place handicap accessible either.",handicap,Positive

That kind of accessibility goes a long way for families like ours. <br/>The amenities were all there great and the location was very conveniently located to many attractions along with Starbucks and a host of other restaurants within a 5 and 10 mins drive. <br/>I would definitely recommend this place as your next Nashville Airbnb stay and will certainly return one day.",elderly,Positive
39971384,Very clean and convenient for all the things we wanted to do in Nashville. But finding the place was difficult because there wasnt accurate pics of the unit location on the website. There was also no mention of two flights of stairs to get to the apartment. If someone wanted to stay at here that was handicapped it wouldnt be accesable. The oven was broken and she claimed that i told her i was 6'2... all that was stated was that i was tall and wanted to make sure i had room on an air mattress. I was told that my husband and i cant share an account on this website cause it breaks the rules.... nice apartment but not worth dealing with the host in the beginning of the trip.,handicap,Neutral

I was extremely pleased and impressed with this place and will definitely book it again when I?m in Nashville. Just a warning, if you are in a wheelchair, the beds are EXTREMELY low and hard for people to transfer you to and from. The only thing I?d recommend is a higher bed.

I got in late, and when I arrived, although it was dark, the backyard had been lit beautifully with string lights, so I had a clear path to the entrance. The grounds were beautiful when I woke up in the morning. Birds chirping. Felt very safe. It was exactly as the pictures and horses in the pasture.

There is a bar literally on the other side of the street that attracts motorcyclists. Saturday night was the worst with nonstop revving of motorcycles, subwoofers, and yelling until 3am. Other nights were also very noisy but we were able to get spotty sleep. After the first night we informed the host and explained we had our elderly mother with us who was unable to sleep. They were not able to offer any solutions except mentioning sometimes the bar holds events and hopefully the other nights won?t be as bad.

My only words of warning have nothing to do with our experience at the condo but I would like to say that it is a 15 minute walk from broadway, which doesn?t  sound like a lot but in the middle of the day during summer, it is a killer!

I can explain & clarify what I experienced and the meager refund that the host provided  ... <br/> Stayed here in JUNE - on a typical  hot Nashville night. Restful nights of sleep were basically all that I wanted for my 4 night stay. I was visiting family; however, I had to cancel after the first night because ... something that was NOT in the photos -<br/>BE AWARE - The PORTABLE AC unit which sits INSIDE the room right next to the bed was NOT shown in the listing photos. The AC unit also has a hose which then vents out the window. This AC unit was extremely loud; the compressor surged and cycled LOUDLY all night long!!  SLEEPING WAS IMPOSSIBLE!<br/>As a result I cancelled a 4 night stay after the first sleepless night!<br/>NOTE: The host recently ADDED to LISTING this quoted COMMENT - ""We have a window air conditioner , one person thought is was too noisy , but all our other guests have not mentioned it and given us great reviews."" <br/>I AM THE ONE PERSON who complained about the air conditioner which is actually a PORTABLE AC UNIT that sits inside the room NEXT to the bed.  CLARIFYING ... it is NOT a regular window air conditioner! It is extremely LOUD - it is alongside the bed right next to your ear!<br/>NOTE THIS - This studio apartment is in the back of a detached garage. To get to the entrance when a car is parked in the narrow driveway is not easy. We had to walk in the grass / dirt area alongside the driveway and then climb over the railroad ties which border the driveway. [Not especially easy when raining or muddy and when toting luggage!]   Then when you step onto the cement driveway you can gain access to the entrance door. Upon leaving there were 2 cars in the driveway which made exiting even more complicated! The entrance is NOT handicap accessible when a car or cars are parked in the driveway!<br/>This host was VERY SLOW to respond after I instituted a dispute request for a fair refund; he was hoping that I would go away and just accept what he chose to credit me!<br/>An adequate and honest refund should have been given! - But Alas!

Caution!! for people who have a hard time with stairs you have to go up 2 flights of stairs to get to the king size bed rooms. One of the bathrooms has a shower with a high tub which made it a little difficult to get in. Also the kitchen & living room is on the 2nd floor so may be a little difficult for an elderly person.

Overall, we knew the home wasn?t the best for families but not because for the reasons i thought. The stairs were the worst part,  3 levels of stairs overall, didn?t know about them until arrival, it was very hard for my dogs short legs and also for my grandma. The house was very clean only the ants were a problem, a lot of food was ruined. The closet in the kitchen had a inappropriate party item in it so ensure children do not go in. The vibe of the neighborhood was weird, its very divided and odd feeling. During stay i alerted the host to  damage of the island in the kitchen, as we sat down for dinner the a piece of support fell off. He was and always was very nice, considerate and HELPFUL! I didn?t alert him to the ants as i  didn?t think anything could have been done. Its definitely not ideal for a family, especially the elderly, small or elderly dogs or children. We mostly stayed on the 2nd floor which is where the loving room and kitchen are, we made the best of it and enjoyed our stay as best as we could. We played lots of games, watched movies and cooked dinner or breakfast.Other days,  we went out for most of the day.

34780200,"Pros: This suite is so beautifully designed. I loved the bathroom, the smell of the soaps provided, and it was a great location for me to attend a conference at the Virgin Hotel. It?s also smack dab in the middle of music row if this is an area you?re interested in and not too far up the street from Belmont U or Vanderbilt medical. And you?re across the street from where Elvis Presley recorded so that?s pretty cool! Entry was easy. It was a studio unit. I didn?t use the kitchen but it seemed to have all the necessities. <br/>Cons: my unit had was on the top floor and had a TON of stairs. I was exhausted hauling just my carry on up- I couldn?t have imagined having more luggage than that (I was on the third floor). Not wheelchair friendly at least from the entrance I found- not sure if there?s an elevator in another part of the building. It?s an older unit, so in spite of the covers I was pretty chilly at night (I?ve let the host know).<br/>If parking, it seems there?s a lot and street parking (I didn?t park).",wheelchair,Negative

34573506,We had 2 couples and 1 single person stay here. Having 3 bedrooms with each room having their own full bathroom was very nice. The half bathroom is on the main floor.

You have a full set of stairs to walk up when you come into the home to get to the main living area. Then another full set of stairs to get to the two bedrooms upstairs. Its not handicap accessible so be sure you know that. <br/>Everything was clean and the bed I slept in (first door on the right upstairs) was very comfortable.   <br/>We rented a car and the drive to Nashville was about 4 miles away.

33958021,"This was a nice place to stay but not for the light or late sleeper. We never had any trouble at night but during working hours the nearby train blew its horn long and loud, construction across the street had constant backup alarms and the fire dept, which must be close, was going by with horns and sirens blaring which made a late sleep or afternoon nap impossible. If you are out exploring early, this wont be a problem most likely.<br/> The rental was very clean and well furnished with things needed. Big white fluffy towels make it good decision to make use of the supplied makeup remover wipes before cleaning up at the end of the day. The place was easy to get into, Close to downtown and host had Great communication. Very few people at the complex during our stay.<br/> Wifi worked well when it was working but was spotty and had 4 active, open ports which was worrisome. <br/>Parking was great except for some older guy with a handicapped plate, got angry at our parking in the spot meant for this rental. He apparently liked the spot for himself and bent our gas cap back trying to break it off when we parked there for the night. We were able to bend it back to acceptable repair but it was frustrating to have to deal with it especially since we were the only ones in the whole lot! This was not the rentals fault by any means and I hope it never happens again but, it happened and I felt it needed being mentioned.<br/>Shower had 2 heads which took a bit of figuring out how to get working together but the reward was a great shower.<br/>Tge bed was firm but comfortable but be warned, it was extremely squeaky! Every toss and turn at night was loudly announced! The room is big and echoey so that compounds the issue. Tge bedroom door is extremely squeaky too, tge bottom hinge is not aligned right and the resulting loud squeaks wakes up the spouse every time. We ended up just leaving it open at night.<br/>Over all i would stay again since the issues didnt affect us all that much. It was so clean and new that we enjoyed tge overall stay.<br/>Third time having to write this review so lil frustrated at airbnb website.",handicap,Neutral
33822680,"You are renting a floor in the house, not the whole house.  If you have the upstairs unit, there is no key to front door (ground level entry).  You have to use a set of steeper stairs to enter unit via back raised patio then can unlock front door from inside.   If you have any type of disability, don't get the top unit.   If you are a simple person, the home is basic with used/worn furniture, dishes, bedspreads, etc.  It worked for me.  My main disappointment was I arrived late after long flight day and had to clean bath tub and wipe down counters/table in kitchen plus sweep upon arrival. I did not clean the refrigerator but it had food/spills in it.   I can't say if a one-time error or not.  About 10 miles from down town  and I appreciated being outside of town.

33269267,"This location is truly one of the most ideal spots for a weekend on Broadway. You will not need to Uber and can easily walk to many places. However, this is probably one of the only pros of this unit. After reading all of the reviews we were slightly hesitant to book this location but there were some good reviews mixed in so we went for it. As a group of 7 guests that stayed here for 4 days??we all agree it?s best to pick somewhere else (to put it nicely). Check in was easy and they were kind enough to let us check in an hour early. When we walked in we were shocked at how absolutely run down and filthy this place was. The carpets were so dirty, stained and black that you could not walk without shoes. The walls were filthy and damaged. The entire couch was stained so badly no one could sit on it without having a towel or blanket down as a barrier. It belongs in the garbage that?s how disgusting it was. The bedroom pillows were old and stained yellow all over from stranger?s sweat. The mattresses were comfortable. One of the beds looked like it hadn?t been changed as it had brown curly hairs all over it. We bought tide pods and had to re wash all of the linens. One guest also has welts all over her upper thigh from being in the bed. They appeared to be bug bites. There was so much dust (literally a thick layer) on the ceiling fan that you couldn?t turn it on without having dust go everywhere. One of the girls used a paper towel to wipe up some water off of the living room floor that she had spilled and the paper towel was completely black. We paid nearly $2,000 for 3 nights and the condition of the loft was unacceptable and uncomfortable. The units are probably not maintained because regardless of whether it?s taken care of or not it?s such a good location that someone will always book it anyway. It?s frustrating because with just a little bit of effort and little bit of $$ this place could be so much better. There?s no stairs so know this prior to booking in case someone in your group is handicapped or elderly. People in other reviews complained about noise but that?s silly of course there will be noise you?re on Broadway! That space has so much potential to look awesome (and it?s not like the pictures).

We originally were staying at a different location but the air conditioning went out and could not be fixed during our stay. Host Extraordinaires had wall air conditioning units put in and fans around the house to try to help but it was still to hot for my Pregnant friend and Elderly Guests. They then quickly offered to move us free of charge to another location they had the same day. Which was beyond nice of them! We moved to this new location but quickly realized their was not enough bedding for the pull out beds and a few wasp nests outside that had let 3 wasps fly into the house. We let host extraordinaires know and they quickly brought over 3 bags of new bedding and pillows within minutes and had maintenance come get rid of the wasps within the hour.

A description of the property should have noted that the 2nd floor access was via stairs only - we could not get our handicapped scooter to the unit. Some in our group didn't mind cool temperatures of 62-68Â°, but others froze day and night. Adjustment of the temperature settings beyond 1 or 2 degrees was not permissable, as the owner's unit and the rental unit share the same thermostat. A courteous request to ownership about the temperature was met only with a screenshot of the setting and comment that the range was set at 67-70 and the message ""Its currently at 68."" While not rude, we felt dismissed and troublesome...almost as if we had fabricated our statement. True, a full on conversation isn't appropriate...but some semblance of helpfulness and intentions that we have a comfortable stay were nonexistent. Perhaps the most difficult part of our stay was the noise. From people upstairs and next door making noise, doors closing, laughter and talking far past 2am, and barking dogs to noisy trash trucks nearly every morning, we found peace and quiet difficult to come by. For the price, we were disappointed by things that were easily managed by proper attention of the ownership, or given a heads up at the ad for rental so that shoppers might prepare or avoid the conditions described. We managed, but wished we had found a property fully ready for customer rental and a quiet setting for those who must sleep a bit longer in the morning, and a unit that could be temperate and comfortable for our group.",handicap,Negative
33189174,Awesome home and great location in a safe neighborhood! Awesome host! Well stocked home. And lay out is perfect.  My only negative and I hate to even say it as a negative. But it is not very accessible for handicap or elderly.  Stairs to get in main entry doors and around home. Also no walk in showers or bars in shower.  Or handheld shower heads. Also no ceiling fans if you like air moving. But Julie was awesome and house was the best location in Nashville. I loved our stay and made many memories!!! Thank you Julie,"handicap, elderly",Neutral

When we arrived the code we were given was not working. We were told to contact the host. We called, left message and he NEVER responded . Once inside the kitchen was dirty. We were forced to leave as I am disabled and could not do the stairs. The host is extremely rude and not helpful in any manner. Never again!","handicap, disabled",Negative

My daughter is in a wheelchair and having the ramp up into the home was wonderful. Everything was very accessible for her. <br/>I loved that the house was so convenient to interstates 24 and 65. It really made navigating Nashville very easy. <br/>I can?t recommend this house enough! You won?t be disappointed.,wheelchair,Positive
32312650,"What an awesome place!  The Iris is so perfectly located that we were never more than 10-20 minutes from anywhere we wanted to be.  The guest book with a detailed list of locally-owned shops and restaurants give us great foodie experiences in walking distance (the awesome Merengue Cafe and the Sunflower Cafe were both next door!) WIthin a two-minute drive were The Nashville Jam Company and Sam and Zoe's for breakfasts.  We just wish we had had more days to try more restaurants!  You'll be proud to pull up in front of this spot with it's cool vibe... all-black exterior with the huge painted Iris mural and the marquis sign make it look so classy.  It's also great for those with accessibility issues if you park out back and stay on the first floor... no steps!  (We were upstairs and so had a view of bamboo trees behind us.)  The towels were fluffy, beds and pillows comfy. Aly and the Iris team were there for speedy replies to inquiries, too!  We'll definitely be back!",no steps,Positive
32311916,This was a great place to stay in! Check in and check out was very easy. The place was very clean and the bed was very comfortable!

I would definitely stay here again!,wheelchair,Neutral

The water pressure and temperature in the shower weren?t too great, but it was fine for a few days. The a/c is nice and cold, and the Roku tv was easy to use. For those in need of handicap accessibility, this is an older and (beautifully!) remodeled motel, so there?s only stairs - be aware before you book. All in all I would absolutely stay here again for a weekend trip to Nashville. The privacy and quiet were both lovely.",handicap,Neutral

The hosts are quick to respond and very helpful with suggestions.  The location is very trendy and the bathrooms are appointed well with shampoo, conditioner & body wash.  The overall cleanliness was average.  We rented two units for our 11 guests.  Two of the bedrooms had bathrooms but the third in each unit did not.  The units have a lot of steps so if you are staying with elderly people steps are mandatory.  Overall, our stay was nice and we had a great weekend.",elderly,Neutral
31952007,"I'm a repeat renter here, as it's a wonderful  spot to stay while visiting my elderly father in Nashville.  It comfortably would fit a family or two couples, though I've stayed here alone and luxuriated in the ample and comfortable space!   The apartment is in a wonderful walkable neighborhood, close to coffee shops, burger joints and stores for browsing. The space is super clean,  charmingly decorated and has a fully appointed kitchen and generous dining space. It has a cozy couch/tv area for getting off your feet after a busy Nashville day. Linda and Jeff are perfect hosts: swift with communication and readily available for any suggestions on restaurants, outings, hikes, music venues!  I'll be back!",elderly,Positive
31881755,"We enjoyed our stay, the communication was amazing! They checked in with us to make sure we arrived safely.   The unit was clean and neat. <br/>I really hate to have to say anything bad, but I want to be honest. <br/>The only issues were if you are mobility challenged. Some things the host had no control over. You have to park in the back and walk to find your building because the buildings are not ""labeled"" from the back side. The night we checked in,  we had to walk this very slight incline area that had snow and slush that was a little tedious. We made sure to get in before the temp dropped and it became black ice. <br/>There are quite a few steps, not a ton, but if someone has mobility issues or handicapped needs, this is may not the unit for you. Also, I stand 5'4 the height of the bed was just below my knees. It was very low and again, if you have mobility issues, this may be a problem. The bed was comfortable though. <br/>Even with this, we did enjoy our stay. I usually travel with someone with mobility issues and I always have to consider them when searching for a place. It may have been in the description and I may have missed it. I don't want someone else to miss it.",handicap,Negative

31057725,Pictures and descriptions are accurate. Great location close to everything even in walking distance. I felt safe. I actually took a solo walk around the neighborhood every morning. The area does have homeless people but they left us alone. Easy check in.  They rent out the upstairs apartment and there are two other apartments in this one house so just be aware of that. It wasn?t loud though. Street parking is fine. Not too crowded. If you are disabled the stairs and yard might be hard to navigate so be aware of that. It?s not an even surface to get to the house. Bed was pretty comfortable. We cooked meals every day there with no issues. I do recommend bringing some disposable stuff because there are only 4 place settings. I used the washer and dryer it was nice to have that. You share with others but we never had to wait. I would stay here again because it was a good deal and the location is great!!,disabled,Negative
30513962,"Laura went far above and beyond to ensure that we had a great experience.

Beds were comfortable, shower was hot. 5 minutes from the airport. My parents found it hard to turn left into the neighborhood from one of the streets because there is a tree blocking the street sign so use your google maps/wayz. We picked this location to be close to my sister's house. It had a lot of restaurants within a 5-10 min drive that we enjoyed.",elderly,Neutral

Nice big table for all to gather for meals, good kitchen, living room.  House is great and there is too much good stuff to mention it all.   Host Marc was wonderful; respectful,  personable and very helpful throughout our stay and went above and beyond when we encountered unexpected difficulties.  Marc was always dependable with transportation to/from airport, downtown and grocery store. He was an exceptional host and The Woodmont Inn was perfect.  We are planning to return next year.

When you get out of the car, you might think it?s on a busy street, but once you close the door it?s a quiet oasis in the city. <br/>The home is HUGE!  All of the bedrooms were large and comfortable. The master bath has a roll in shower that was perfect for someone in a wheelchair. The other two bathrooms were well appointed and had everything we needed. The kitchen also was great to prepare meals in. <br/>The host is very nice and accommodates and anticipates every need.

One drawback is there are many, many stairs to get up from street level, and would not be a good fit for young children or anyone needing stroller/wheelchair accessibility. But Joe and Brandi are excellent hosts, the place was sparkling clean and had new finishes throughout. The rooftop deck has stunning views of downtown and we really enjoyed our stay overall.",wheelchair,Negative
29705296,"I was a little nervous about staying at Bode not knowing exactly what to expect but we were pleasantly surprised.  We were contacted prior to arrival via text by a personal concierge.  They were prompt in answering all our questions.  It was nice not having to keep up with a key & having a code to get into everything.<br/>It is a U shaped complex & the courtyard is awesome!  It has several sitting areas,  firepits & corn hole.  It was a great place to hangout.  There is a Cafe that has some pre-made foods like egg bites, oatmeal, cinnamon buns, & bagels.  They also make delicious specialty coffees.  The bar open on weekend evenings has live entertainment & a wide selection of beverages.  In the courtyard they made a stage out of an old flatbed truck & I think have entertainment there in the warmer months.  Being the 1st weekend of December it was just something cool to look at for us.<br/>The room 207 was clean, comfortably & beautifully decorated.   The water pressure was so strong it almost hurt but so much better than low pressure.  The room was well equipped  and had most everything we needed.  <br/>We did wish there was a small desk to work from & maybe a small dresser to unpack our stuff but that wasn't a huge deal.  We also had my Dad with us & he would have liked a handicapped bar for the toilet & shower but it's possible some rooms do have those...not sure.  <br/>The beds were very comfortable & we all slept really well.  Since you are on the edge of downtown you often hear sirens but not so loud to disturb sleep.  <br/>Being so close to downtown is a huge plus because parking is minimal & you can walk to most places.  There were several comments in other reviews about the Bode lot filling up & having to pay again to park across the street.  Luckily we didn't have an issue while we were there but it did make us paranoid when we did have to drive somewhere.  <br/>Also the Metropolis parking system can be confusing.  Scan the QR code to get to their website.  Know your license plate & go to your room.  Register on the website.  Once you pick your time, on the fridge there is another QR code to use to get 50% off parking.  This brought us down to $20 for 24 hours.<br/>We will definitely stay at the Bode again.  We wonder why anyone would stay in a hotel when you can stay in a 2 room apartment with a kitchen & living area.  Our last night we stayed at Opryland & though the place is beautiful we got spoiled with our accommodations at the Bode.",handicap,Positive
29438857,"I wish I could rate Denise?s place as a 4.8 but the site won?t let me that specific. It was the perfect first-stop as I was traveling with my dog from Asheville, NC to our new home in Denver, CO. The neighborhood and space was very quiet and restful. The room and bath were impeccably clean, and what an amazing bathtub! The lights were on when I checked in and overall, I couldn?t have been more pleased. <br/>My only reason for not making it a perfect 5 was a minor incident when I first arrived that made getting into the apartment itself a bit difficult. Her two pups had been let out just prior to our arrival. Not a problem in and of itself as Cocoa is very social, but she is elderly (15 1/2) and topples easily. Denise?s pups are very exuberant greeters, and their energetic presence around the gate and our door made it rather difficult to get a 52 pound dog through a latched gate and into our room. They were all over Cocoa and around my feet as I tried to open the door. <br/>At no time did Denise come out to gather her dogs. I would say she wasn?t aware we had arrived, but I had given her an ETA, and the dogs were pretty emphatic with their announcement. She even texted me with an apology for what happened, so she was aware, but I never saw her. She only went on to say in her text that she had forgotten the dogs were out.<br/>That being said, I never heard another peep out of her sweet dogs, and they are, indeed, very sweet - just filled with lots of energy. If I could do it over again? I would have messaged Denise and nicely asked her to get her dogs off of the deck before I let myself in. Other than that initial hiccup, Denise?s place was a nice, relaxing stop before moving on to our second leg in Kansas City. I slept like a baby. I would definitely stay there again!",elderly,Neutral

The house was far more spacious, better stocked, and way cleaner than any hotel I?ve ever been in, and for about the same price. The house was beautifully set up and uniquely eclectic, plus, beautiful, live plants everywhere and lovely landscaping in a quiet neighborhood. I love seeing the personal and unique style of individuals rather than the stale, cookie cutter look of hotels. My parents, who I brought with me, are elderly and have trouble getting around. It was as easy as it was at their own house to move about. The beds??oh my??so comfy!! I?m not sure how I got anything accomplished?I wanted to stay in bed.

I was here with my wife, college-age son, and elderly mother-in-law and it was perfect place for us.  <br/>Good things:  Location.  Chicago is a big city and no place is close to everything but this is central.  If you wanted to walk to ""th e bean"" (Cloudscape) for example, you could walk a few blocks up Dearborn, passing first a magnificent Calder, then a magnificent Chagal, and then a magnificent Picasso sculpture.  Turn right, and head for the Frank Gerhry concert stage and all of Grant park.  Walk easily to the river. There is an El stop right there outside the building. <br/>The apartment itself:  relatively spacious, newly refurbished, attractive, functional furniture, nice modern art.  The kitchen is new and things work well.  Views from the apartment are great.  You nearby buildings have interesting ornamentation, and more distant ones are attractive.  You can see out to the lake between them. Having a washer and drier in the unit was handy. <br/>Good to know:  It's not quiet.  Remember the El?  Trains run all night and you can hear loud music from passing cars, even 15 floors up. It's Chicago.  There are sirens.   The unit has multiple, good sound machines, which you are likely to want.  We did not hear any noise from neighboring units.  The unit faces East and South--you get a lot of light, which is nice in the day but if you need dark to sleep bring your own mask. In terms of kitchen supplies, there is cleaning stuff, salt, pepper, and coffee filters.  Anything else you need to supply.  Parking can be a bit of a pain.  We used Spothero and the garage at 318 S. Federal--very nearby.",elderly,Neutral

Anyone could access the building. The actual unit was exactly what it needed to be and met my expectations here.

A cute small garden between the two houses with many flowers allows having your morning coffee under a peach tree. Lots of restaurants and coffeeshops within about a 10-minute walk, and both the park and the Blue Line stop at 5-10 minutes as well. With the Blue Line connecting from O'Hare to the center of Chicago (and beyond), it's easy to explore the sights using public transport.

53496895,"Before you read ahead, please keep in mind that I've never written a negative review. I've never had to. This will be my first.<br/>Nat's place is great in terms of the relative size of the apartment and its location. Much of everything else leaves a A LOT to be desired, so much so that I'd like make sure that the next guests demand that these issues be attended to. If you are a stickler for cleanliness, look elsewhere. The fridge was visibly dirty, sticky, and emitted a foul odor. There was a  loaf of bread sitting in the cupboard that was covered in mold. When I say ""covered,"" I mean entirely coated in thick, hairy blue-green mold and liquefying at the bottom of the bag.  When we threw it out, it kicked up a large cloud of spores and had half of our party of eight dealing with allergies throughout the stay. The bathroom had a used razor in the tub. There was also a half-used bar of soap still in the dish. The vents, floors, windowsills are all covered in dust and hair. We suspected that the space hadn't been cleaned between guests. Only the bedsheets had be changed.<br/>This next bit is important. The thermostat is locked behind a plastic case. You do not have access to it. There was no way for us to adjust the temperature during what was one of the hottest days of the summer last Friday. The thermostat is supposedly set to a ""range"" between 70-74 degrees, but given that it's a top floor apartment, it felt much higher than that and took all night to cool down. We had to leave the apartment after checking in and did not return until after sunset. The a/c is set to turn on automatically, so the fan would only turn on for a few minutes at a time to little effect. There is no ventilation in the main area otherwise, aside from a ceiling fan in the dining room. If you have a disability, are elderly or  sensitive to heat then this will not be a comfortable stay for you, unless you're into sweating in bed.<br/>Lastly, this is a party building. The listing does not suggest that it is. We don't mind that our neighbors throw parties, but there should be some acknowledgement in the listing that the space has been or can be used this way. There is also an added security concern since the front door was propped open by a Powerade bottle all weekend. Every time we would close it, we'd find it propped open once we returned.<br/>In sum, this is a big space in a great location, but some real dealbreakers in terms of cleanliness, temperature, and security.","disability, elderly",Negative

We were able to walk to many attractions and Ubers would show up at the door within 5 minutes every time.  We did not need a car for our 3 day stay.  Despite being in the middle of the Loop I found the interior of the condo quiet, you could hear the outside but it was muted and did not bother us at all.

52936284,We stayed at Kyle & Bryttie's place for almost five weeks and it truly felt like a home away from home. The location is really great.

We have 4 kids under age 10  and had no problem getting around without a car for our stay. <br/>The unit was even more updated and spacious than the listing showed. <br/>This unit is on the third floor and there are probably 50+ steps but I looked at it as a good workout.

45812729,"This apartment is decent for the price and affordable for big city standards, so I give it kudos for that.  I gave suggestions to the owner for minor investments to make the stay better for future guests (appropriate number of towels/washcloths, blankets for the beds in addition to the lightweight comforters) that I trust she'll address.  <br/>What is unlikely to change are the two flights of very steep, rather narrow, and oddly uneven stairs that are a challenge to navigate even when stone sober and reasonably agile.  Adding suitcases to the mix is ill advised for the elderly or infirm.  <br/>Once in the apartment, it's obvious that whoever remodeled the apartment didn't address or overcome the underlying settling of the building, so the floors are slanted in multiple directions.  If this apartment were in San Francisco, where earthquakes are a concern, I would not have felt comfortable staying one night.  But given that Chicago is seismically stable, it was just a woozy annoyance.  Walking from the front bedroom across the living room to the bathroom is akin to walking the deck of a small ship in a large storm.  (My teenager says the severity of my point here is overblown.)  My husband suggested if we'd been drinking it would have been more fun...<br/>To end on positive notes, the apartment is in easy walking distance of several fine restaurants (that offer takeout!), a slightly more adventurous walk's distance to the Field Museum, and you can see the Willis Tower from the front bedrooms or the living room, where there's a nice little table for two.  We quite enjoyed dining there!  We let the teenagers eat at the table in the kitchen.",elderly,Negative

It is really not conducive to cooking, but that may not bother most people. <br/>It was relatively quiet except for a loud __hunk_ that happened almost exclusively at night.

Also within walking distance of a wonderful Korean market with everything you could want + fantastic dumplings, and a laundromat around the corner. Check in was easy, all doors use keypad codes which made things quick and simple. Something to be aware of is the rooms downstairs (eg: in the basement) can be tricky to access; the staircase is narrow and it winds sideways at the bottom. If you have a disability or otherwise mobility issues I__ recommend staying in an upstairs (which is the main level) room. Bringing bags up and down the stairs was also a bit difficult but I managed. Wifi connection in the basement corner room was a bit weak, so I would not recommend that room if you plan on working while traveling. It is definitely a solid place to sleep and a good jumping-off point for trips into the city and surrounding areas. Francisco accommodated my requests for extra pillows and a later check-out time, and was friendly and quick to respond. I also saw him cleaning almost every day, so he is attentive to the condition of the house and will handle issues as they arise.

The area is quiet but many resident Chicagoan people told us to be careful at night, but I think they were thinking of west humboldt. This made us feel conflicted about navigating the area which we generally thought was lovely and quiet but it felt cut off by North Ave. we are from london and used to navigating all sorts of areas. but in future I would rather stay somewhere near shops and grocery stores. it was too faraway really to enjoy our time in the area. we did food shopping and took uber's back to the flat. it was exhausting and overwhelming since I am disabled. the flat was nice, lovely kitchen, bright, lovely textiles and plants. but only convienent if you have a car probably.",disabled,Neutral

We cooked most nights and found the kitchen well equipped, including some improvements offered once suggested. The Alexa in each room is a nice touch. Once we started chatting with Alex he was responsive and engaging. Reimbursement for parking was a nice gesture. He also solicited improvement suggestions mid stay and responded to a request to secure a mid stay clean.<br/>In a first reading the house rules are somewhat legalistic which made us slow to reach out after our early check in wasn__ possible.

But the open floor plan actually turned out to be very comfortable! The little touches like the shampoo in the bathroom were very thoughtful. Check in and check out were a breeze, and Brad was accommodating and easy to communicate with. The only thing I would caution is that the basement level has a flight of descending stairs right at the entrance, so be aware of that if you're in a wheelchair or on cructches, etc., or if you have super heavy luggage.

Also it can get dark at night and you have to reach the end of the stairs before you can turn on the lights. This was a fall risk especially when you have an elderly with you. <br/>- The bathroom needed a deep clean. the bathtub walls had clumps of hairs. This was appalling! like it was never cleaned from previous guests. <br/>- Once we arrived and opened one of the rooms upstairs and there was a strong odor. The host claimed the sheets might have been ""damped"" causing the odor. But I think it came from the rugs. The rugs looked very old and dirty! If you have asthma, I will suggest bringing an Air filter. As I felt clogged up each night.<br/>- It rained heavily our 2nd night and water sipped from the kitchen window into the kitchen and one of the rooms. The window was closed and never touched. However, the window seal needs to be fixed..as I believe this has happened before..with the smell of the rugs coming from the rooms. <br/>- For three guests booked we were only given 2 towels. Even when I asked for more towels (which he brought initially) he took ALL of them back after he saw we only used 1 towel on the floor when it flooded. Then came back with Just ONE! to replace the one used on the floor. Like how bad are you miserly with TOWELS!! even the towels all had make up stains!<br/>- Just overall not an all round clean place.

Street parking on this street (and in the neighborhood) is FREE! There are also plenty of paid parking options around it, but we managed to find a parking spot directly in front of house. This is a third floor unit, and the stairs are something to keep in mind when booking if you have any elderly guests. It's a typical Chicago townhouse, though, so just be prepared for very narrow, steep, curving steps. Bringing our luggage up and down the stairs was really the only pain point for that. <br/>Would definitely stay here again!",elderly,Neutral

The furniture had some wear and tear and there was no cleaning supplies available like a broom and mop but overall the place was exactly what we__ expected, very beautiful home. Saul was even courteous enough to offer a early check in for my family. Be aware that there are a lot of stairs and not ideal for elderly. Thank you Saul.",elderly,Negative
34818035,We felt a little misled by previous reviews. The location of the space was not the best. It was in an area transitioning from nice to sketchy. There was a security system but was told it was disabled and couldn__ be used. There was a dead mouse in the dirty hallway connecting the house to the garage. And we experienced a very loud outdoor party at the neighbors house that lasted until 1 am. The space itself was nice but needed some maintenance. The beds were comfortable and clean. There were two skylights in the upstairs bedrooms that made the mornings quite bright early. We would recommend adding a toaster to the kitchen. Abacus was responsive and respectful during our stay trying to accommodate us.,disabled,Neutral

33667922,"If you stay at 31-32 you are on the third floor with stairs as your only option __ which was fine because none of our people were disabled. It was a really nice area lots of stuff talking distance from the place. Free Street parking is nonexistent fri & sat but parking lots are very close by for $15 a night. It__ cheap to Uber/walk everywhere and I would definitely recommend that. Rooms in 31 were tiny and the living room was very small. 32 was definitely larger in every category. Easy to hang out with large groups (9) in 32. Over all very clean and nice, but the cleaning we were instructed to do was a lot, sweep the floors, take the sheet/bedding off, take trash out, do the dishes and put them away just a lot to do for a place we payed over 1,200+ to stay at but hey nice area, clean house, and good host. Wifi was also in and out but good phone signal otherwise.",disabled,Negative
33636138,"Gabriel and Tina were perfect hosts who from first contact on answered all our questions promptly and thoroughly. We had asked for public transit directions from Midway to the home and Gabriel sent the info immediately. <br/>The neighbourhood is charming, quiet and very safe. We returned from downtown at 11 PM and walked home from the 18th Street subway station without any issues; equally so from the Damen station, both on the Pink Line.<br/>There is a Puerto Rican restaurant just east of (past) 18th Str. station that serves delicious food at a very reasonable price as well as an All Day Breakfast and Brunch place on Damen just south of 18th Place where an elderly lady cooks and insists you read the Chicago Tribune over breakfast. Super charming.<br/>We suggest you take public transit to get around town. The Ventra multiple day pass can be bought at all subway stations incl. Midway, O'Hara and at the central train station and is valid on all buses as well. We bought the 72 hour pass for $20. It's super easy to get to the Loop/downtown on the Pink Line (about a 15 min. ride every 8-12 min. approx.) but also to other neighbourhoods of Chicago.<br/>If you are wondering whether to take a river boat tour we highly recommend doing so. We went on the 7:30 PM Architectural Tour and learned a great deal about Chicago's architectural history while sipping wine and watching the city light up as night fell. The tour provided a great intro to Chicago as a whole and was utterly romantic ;) plus you can be back at Casa 18th Place in 30 minutes on the Pink Line, boat to door.<br/>We highly recommend staying at Casa 18th Place; it's good value and Gabriel and Tina are responsible and caring hosts.",elderly,Neutral
33527045,This was an AMAZING home & Annie was the PERFECT host. There are a few things I would like to note about the home before choosing <br/>1) there are ALOT of stairs to get into the home and even more if you choose to stay upstairs in the home. Please prepare for that if you have elderly or children with you while traveling. <br/>2) Parking is a bit of hassle. You will have to pay for parking. And walking during the cold is the worst! <br/>3) Keep in mind if you are traveling with a large group there are only 2 bathrooms that aren't that big in size. <br/>4) Is it is the middle of Chinatown so if you are not a big fan of Asian food (I am a big fan) this is not the place for you.<br/>All of these are just some things to keep in mind when booking the home. Like I said before this is an AMAZING home and I would def book this home in the summer to sit on the balcony. Thanks again Annie!,elderly,Negative

33036432,"The pros:  we were overall happy with our stay.  The location can__ be beat if you need Lakewood/Ravenswood, the garage parking was so helpful, and the price was right.  We were with my elderly grandma and this was one of the few places we could find with only a half-flight of stairs.  We loved having control of the thermostat instead of having radiators we couldn__ change.  The separated spaces were really helpful.<br/>The cons: the rugs really needed to be cleaned, and the bench in the downstairs apartment had a cushion that was quite stained.  One of my he members of our party wore white socks in the house and they got pretty dirty even though we all took our shoes off as requested.  The oven in the upstairs unit took much longer than normal to cook things_ we did not try the downstairs oven but it was much newer so it may work better.<br/>Overall, great location and a good stay, but probably wouldn__ stay again unless we needed the space due to the carpet and stained cushion.",elderly,Neutral
33036432,"Joshua__ place was perfect for us! We loved having 2 separate spaces. It was perfect for all of us. The only downside was that there were no handrails by the stairs, which made it difficult for my elderly parents. But, other than that, it was great! Comfy beds! Nice, quiet, safe neighborhood. We loved having a garage spot for our car. We parked it and left it there for the entire time. Super easy to catch the Brown line from there! Thank you!",elderly,Negative

If you visit with children, there is a wonderful playground down at the Lakeview high school just a block away. Josh was incredibly responsive if I had any questions. Only downside would be if you were traveling with elderly folks that find stairs challenging_ This unit has very steep stairs.",elderly,Negative

32934782,"Wendy and Matt are the ultimate hosts- respond quickly to queries, were extremely detailed in instructions and expectations.  My husband is a disabled vet, so we were concerned about parking and they were able to accommodate us with a space in the building for a fee.  This was the decision maker for us, and it was well worth it.  We were visiting Chicago for medical appointments, and the unit location was perfect for getting to our appointments on time, and also taking advantage of Chicago's entertainment and great restaurants.  My only complaint is not with Wendy and Matt or the unit, but the many fees associated with renting through AirBNB - the cost of the rental was almost double what was quoted, which felt a bit like a bait and switch on the website's part - not Wendy and Matt's fault. Overall, we will likely return to Chicago for some additional medical appointments and will certainly check availability for this unit.",disabled,Positive

We are in Chicago pretty regularly for work and will definitely book Richard__ place again. 10/10 would recommend.",wheelchair,Positive
32877806,"Wonderful stay and our host was so helpful and responsive. I will say that the place is very much like a home which is wonderful for those who want the feeling of home away from home. If you use accessibility aids the place is mostly accessible except the bathroom will be tight if you have a standard sized wheelchair. The kitchen is a small galley style kitchen as picture and worked fine since I did the cooking however, if you are a wheelchair user looking to stay here by yourself the kitchen may not work for you. The neighborhood is quiet and located not too far from the amenities of the city. Overall, this airbnb is a great find and well worth it.",wheelchair,Negative

A NO would have been reasonable but she had the nerve to suggest that her items would accidentally be __aken_ from the unit, blaming my disability/ADHD. <br/>Lilian was TOO comfortable asking if I could help check-in/assist other guests in other units.

It was helpful being so close to the Blue Line- just a note for those using strollers, the station is not handicap accessible (just steps and no elevator option).

30204360,"The apartment itself was very nice and homey, but I feel obligated to let other potential renters know that our car was keyed and both driver__ side tires were slashed while we were staying here. Just the towing and tire replacement alone cost us $600. We have not yet priced the bodywork. At first we thought the car was only keyed, but once the snow died down and we dug out the car, we realized two tires were flat. The towing company and the tire shop both confirmed that the tires had clean cuts as if they were punctured on purpose. <br/>We__e new to the area and don__ know anyone, so this was just a random act of violence that impacted us a lot. Our car was parked just down the block on the corner of Belle Plaine and Mango. This act isn__ necessarily the hosts_ fault, but others need to be aware that their cars won__ be safe with the street parking here. <br/>When it snows, it__ impossible to park next to the Airbnb.

It's marketed for solo or couple travelers and I believe that to be true. I wouldn't stay here for an extended stay because the space is really tight and the beds are incredibly uncomfortable. My boyfriend and I woke up feeling terrible and groggy, ended up not being able to finish the day without checking into another hotel and taking a long nap. The room decor is designed tastefully but outside of the aesthetic I don't think we would stay here again. As a single night, it would do the job though. Just a point of reference, I am 5'2, 115 lbs and my boyfriend is 5'10, 200 lbs. If you are on the larger/taller side or in a wheelchair, it may not be the best experience.",wheelchair,Negative

There are a lot of stairs so if elderly or handicap be sure to look at the photos.  The stairs did not bother us one bit.  We wish we could have used the courtyard but directions said not to so we did not and had a great time anyways.  Thank you Conor for everything.  Especially the parking pass although parking is not too bad without one.  I think the furthest any one of us parked was 2 blocks away and that was only one time and a quick walk.

Trendy Restuarants are a little father away toward Palmer and Logan Squares; great if you want some exercise.<br/>The Coach House accommodations were quite pleasant, clean and artfully decorated. There is a locked gate at the sidewalk entrance, but the neighborhood is generally safe.  There was a moderate climb up a dozen steps to the front door, so it's not handicapped accessible.

25892484,"Alex was cool. He was prompt in responding to my messages. However, there are some areas I would have appreciate more clarity on. Firstly, there are 5 keys. You need to color code these or do something to differentiate because as a guest, it's my first visit there so I am not familiar with this.<br/>Secondly, you need to be more specific on parking. As an out of state visitor, you explicitly said ""you can park ANYWHERE on the block."" You should've said ""Feel free to park anywhere except for areas that have disabled/reserved parking signs."" There are branches covering these signs so I was not aware of them.<br/>Thirdly, tenants upstairs were yelling and being very obnoxious.

Close to the Wicker Park and Humboldt Park neighborhoods, the Riviera Theater (concert venue), the Aragon Ballroom (concert venue), and the Garfield Conservatory (a must see!). Only a 30 minute drive to Chicago Botanic Garden (another must see!) and a 20 minute drive to downtown Chicago. Also within short driving distance are Kuma's Corner, a great heavy metal themed burger joint, and Bucket o' Blood, an eclectic local bookstore catering to fantasy, sci-fi, and horror fans. The apartment is located in a very quiet and safe neighborhood. Street parking is available but you need a permit sticker which Al and Mary provide. However, we did find that if you get back too late at night (midnight or after), finding a spot to park can be difficult. We accidentally parked in a handicapped spot one night and the next night we had to park around the corner on Kimball because all of the other residential parking nearby are different permit numbers. It wasn't a big deal - just be prepared. One last thing: Mary will answer any questions you may have immediately. That was MUCH appreciated.",handicap,Neutral

Min met us for check in, even though it was past 8 p.m., carried my bags in (I am disabled and use a cane) and pulled out the sofa bed for us.  He also gave us extra coffee and water when we asked.  I couldn't ask for a more attentive host.  Also, I thought we might have been too loud, but he said they didn't hear us.  The space is a good size for the location, but smaller than I expected.  Still, it was not a problem.  The neighborhood felt very safe and the space did as well.  I would definitely stay here again.  It was a great experience.",disabled,Positive
24798790,"Review is based on 2 month business stay at unit 1F (1st floor facing main street ) without a car. <br/>TLDR: good place, needs some TLC, recommend for 1-4 easy going people on a short trip to Chicago for fun.<br/>PROS: location is great, safe neighborhood, private entry easy to access, short walk to many bus lines, in-unit laundry, smart thermostat worked well, comfortable beds/couch, great refrigerator/oven/microwave, nice natural light from windows, ceiling fan came in handy, fast responses from host.<br/>CONS: walls are paper thin, every step above is heard and in my case included many near-sleepless nights from late night loud tenants, water pressure isn't great and takes awhile to get hot in the kitchen especially (which sucks since there's no dishwasher), windows great but none of them open so no way to get natural air outside of small bathroom window, windows undressed so sun pours in through blinds in morning, laundry is type with many very loud buzzer signals that can't be disabled.",disabled,Neutral
24754678,"the place is very old (vintage charm?). the front door is up a long flight of very steep narrow old stairway, which makes it difficult to navigate a 50lb suitcase, and could pose a problem to those with heart issues, arthritis or the elderly. <br/>the bedrooms are very small.<br/>the single small bathroom makes it difficult for more than 2 adults to share.<br/>having said that, the place is very clean; hardwood floors throughout; new windows; the central heater worked well. wi-fi worked well. <br/>it was less than we expected but it was ok",elderly,Negative
24631833,"Lilian__ place was exactly what we needed over the Christmas holiday. She ran out and provided a coffee grinder when I asked if there was one at the property, and was very thoughtful and responsive during our stay - even bringing over a fan for those of us who were used to white noise when going to sleep! Plus fresh flowers and a holiday card were waiting on the kitchen counter for us when we arrived.<br/>The building is gorgeous and one of a kind. The apartment was beautiful and immaculate with lots of space for my elderly mother and my adult children. Having previously lived in Chicago for over 20 years, I was familiar with the location and it was extremely convenient - grocery stores and pharmacies a 1 - 2 minute walk, really good local taco places just down the street. My friends and relatives live very close to the property in Rogers Park and just past the border of Evanston, which was so very ideal. Not too far from O__are airport as well.

24034913,"Isaac has a great place that is located about 30 minutes bus ride away from the Chicago Loop (Downtown), in the Ukrainian village.  It's a lovely apartment that Isaac also shares with the AirB&B guests (shared bathroom and amenities). Four things worthy of note (some of which are already mentioned by other guests):<br/>1) You must get a combined Ventra CTA (metro) and Bus ticket as the apartment is a good 20-30 minute walk from the Blue CTA line (Western) or the Green CTA line (California) but it is perfectly accessible by numerous buses that go in/out of town 24/7 - buses are the way to get to and fro - but from O'Hare you'd get the Blue CTA line to Western and then the bus (or walk). I paid $28 for a 7-day unlimited ride ticket - it was brilliant! Use the ""Citimapper"" smartphone app too - it gives you live updates on buses/trains/uber etc<br/>2) The apartment is on the 1st floor, and it's a walk up. This is no big deal and easy enough (single flight of stairs) - just saying, as some people have mentioned in previous reviews they expected an elevator.<br/>3) The apartment is over a bar (the EZ Inn) - again, this is mentioned in many of the reviews. You DO hear the noise/music/chatter from the bar, and it DOES go on until well after 2am (longer on weekends). Again, this wasn't necessarily a problem (because it was expected), in fact the bar is quite fun and you should go down for a drink, but just be aware it is noticeable - very much so.<br/>4) This one isn't in the reviews (that I've seen) or in the description, but there's an active webcam in the kitchen above the pots and pans (which you really don't notice and I only saw by accident), facing towards the entrance door that Isaac uses (there are 2 entries into the flat, the AirB&B one, and Isaac's one).  The reason I mention it is because it is also pointing in the direction of the hallway right where the bathroom door is and I only spotted it after 3 days of walking around (naked) what I thought was an empty apartment.  I asked Isaac about it and he assured me ""it isn't recording"" - but it's active and it's clearly transmitting something somewhere. I'm not prudish and I'm sure it's nothing sinister as Isaac is a genuinely nice guy, but I am mentioning it so you have the option of covering up to protect your modesty should you desire (or asking that it's disabled for the duration of your stay).<br/>In summary though - a great place to stay - affordable and convenient. :-)",disabled,Neutral
24010772,"Perfect! I had a family gathering of 27 to celebrate my daughter becoming a doctor. The big table in the dining room was perfect for my buffet of 6 hors d oeuvres, 4 main courses, bread and a large cake.  Joshua went above any expectation to help find ways to make his home accessible by wheelchair and in fact split the cost of renting a lift. He modified his shower head to a handheld version just for us. My heart strings were tugged by Joshua being so considerate so that my wheelchair'd daughter could attend the event of her sister becoming a doctor.",wheelchair,Positive

23768638,"Located in Bucktown right north of pretty Wicker Park. We booked this unit for my elderly mother-in-law for an entire August. We found it extremely neat with all furniture in good condition; the mattresses stand out as more comfortable than most AirBnB's we've rented in the past. It came with enough coffee pods for a month and almost all little things you need in an apartment, like shampoo, etc. For 1 or 2 people it is spacious, but each of the two beds would also sleep 2 couples, and storage space is good for a vacation home. Nathan is a very organized and responsive host who answered most of our questions before we even thought of them.<br/>It's a short foot walk to the Blue Line, which leads both to neighboring Wicker Park (1 stop only) and into the heart of Chicago.  It also directly connects to O'Hare. The neighborhood is quiet, but once in Wicker Park you find plenty of evening entertainment if that's what you want. There's a nice coffee shop and a couple restaurants around the corner, and an Aldi a 10 minute footwalk away for groceries. The Bloomingdale Trail, Chicago's version of NYC's High Line, is within 5 minutes on foot. <br/>Our favorite ""amenity"", entirely optional, was Nathan's dog Lulu. She's super friendly, very well-behaved, and if you want to will follow you inside for belly-rubs.",elderly,Neutral
23609502,"The Airbnb is worth it!<br/>Not only was the price, fulfilling to it's extensive qualities, but the cleanliness and amount of room was great! <br/>The place looked just exactly like the photos. However, there are steps leading down to the place. It's steep and might not be best suited with person(s) difficult walking or disabled/injured. <br/>My cousin and I stayed there for a few days, and the one thing I complain about most is the upper level noise. Though mostly at night, you can hear the treading and footsteps to people above. Even loud laughs. <br/>The bedroom though was most comfortable. Though not the biggest, the amount of storage including extra towels, blankets, and good amount of hangers were very helpful and made our stay easier. <br/>The living room was extra spacious that could fit many guests. Next to it, the kitchen was spacious, open, and had most the amenities one could want including ground coffee maker, pots/pans, utensils, dishes, spices, and cleaning supplies just below the sink. The couch is not the most comfortable, and may need to be replaced. <br/>Lastly, the bathroom included some shampoo and conditioner and a blow dryer. I would recommend if you are particular about those necessities, bring your own. There was no bathroom mat for the shower, which made is a little difficult stepping out because the shower head was pointing directly outwards just barely getting more water outside of the shower door. <br/>Overall, I would recommend the place for a 2-3 person stay. There's one bed but the couch can add an additional person. Great price and such a great city. Thank you!",disabled,Negative

Yes, there is street parking, but a majority of the spots were either handicap reserved parking or permit parking.

21817363,"Honestly, there were so many signs posted throughout the place explaining the rules. One or two gets the idea across, but six is obsessive.  Especially having them on the table where people eat, or watch tv. The rules are already explained in the airbnb app. Too many signs felt restricting and uncomfortable. Not the most enjoyable stay.  Walls are also too thin. I could hear people laughing upstairs and the tv playing, as well as a cat or dog sliding across the floor. That should've been explained in the description a bit better about the noise. <br/>It's a place I would recommend for elderly people but not for socialites. Other than that, the place was beautiful. Clean and organized. There wasn't any hand soap in the second bathroom though. Parking was not great. It took about 20-30 mins to find street parking. The option to park in the garage was available but the host would've had to come and move his car to accommodate that. <br/>Overall, it was okay. It was just for one night. Also, as a personal preference, I don't like meeting the hosts. I like being able to come from traveling and just relax without having to have someone explain the rules that are in the app and that they have signs posted throughout their place saying the same thing.",elderly,Neutral

Ross was very thoughtful to reach out and warn us about the upstairs kid noises ahead of time, which we didn't find bothersome at all, just usual apartment noises. One thing future guests may want to be aware of is that there is a big step down to get between the mudroom and kitchen, which I tripped over a number of times.

21149807,"Stay the hell away from Greenleaf House if you are disabled, and maybe if even you're not, unless you crave an unsafe, commune environment!  It's an absolute nightmare for seniors and especially for disabled people - No ADA provisions whatsoever!  My partner was afraid to negotiate the staircase with inadequate rail support more than absolutely required. Upstairs bathrooms are particularly dangerous, even for people without disabilities - an injury lawsuit just waiting to happen.  One bathroom is especially attractive, but a flimsy swinging glass shower door mounted on top of a slippery tub, with no stable way to grab anything if needed, just begs for accidents. No grab bars anywhere. We had to buy a shower mat to help insure our safety!  A minuscule waste basket with hard to reach foot pedal shoved way under the sink is pitifully small for a house that accommodates 12 people, and overflows by each day's end. The basement railing is loose and treacherous.  Outside, there are no safe railings for people with mobility issues.<br/>Speaking of outside, the entrance lock system is temperamental at best, and phantom Greenleaf host Brian is not only generally invisible, but also unreachable when the locks failed, which was daily. Other guests who happened to be nearby let us in. <br/>Even more outrageous, Greenleaf prominently posted a former guest__ phone number both at the outside entrance and upstairs hallway to call for help when locks fail, which of itself indicates awareness of a problem.  We called that number when we were locked out around 10 pm, and encountered a very frustrated woman who had once been a Greenleaf guest and didn't understand why she kept getting calls for help!  Well, it's because Greenleaf posted her number! That poor woman. Not only is this unethical and possibly illegal, but further attempts to reach Brian (finally, the only way was through his website) resulted in a delayed (as in next day) and aloof text response from a New York based phone number. Shame on you, Brian, wherever you are!<br/>Before these discoveries, upon arrival, we were coincidentally greeted not by the host but  by another very friendly guest named Gaston. I hope he receives lodging for free because he__ the only thing that keeps the place running smoothly. The days during our stay when Gaston was absent resulted in filthy kitchen conditions, non-replenishment of Greenleaf's advertised complementary fruit and breakfast items, no clean bath towels but instead wet, filthy ones left lingering in both the bathroom and hallway basket in the morning. Ewww!  Gaston should be retained as permanent staff.<br/>Let me describe cramped Room #1, where we stayed. The ""queen"" bed was the smallest we've seen and rock hard like a trampoline. We had to crab walk around to its other side, where a small lamp was unplugged and the headboard jammed so close to the wall that there was no way for us to plug in the cord. There was no room for a chair or anything else. We left the closet light on as a nightlight.<br/>We rented an Airbnb, not a hostel. While the location is great, the vibe is creepy, especially  when Gaston is absent. We learned that the price is even cheaper if you book directly through Greenleaf's website. Guess you get what you pay for.  <br/>Bottom line: Do not rent this quirky, subpar property!","disabled, grab bars",Negative

19960802,"This location was perfect for my personal stay. I helped move my sister into her college (DePaul, Chicago, IL) and this location was only 15-20 minutes away. It was very close to the downtown Northside of Chicago, and had a parking space for in-and-out day-to-day parking, along with a private space if you prefer a gated/locked location for extra security. The location was clean, and stalked up with toiletries, along with plenty of space to settle in. Their was an AC unit which was perfect for the summer stay I planned. Personally I did not utilize transit in this area, but it was still fairly close to 24 hour transit. Though I did not have more than 2 people with me in the location, it could have held a good 5-6 people comfortably. Communication was the only possible issue, but messages were never responded to or unread past 10 hours. However from the beginning, the instructions were given, and never changed, so communication was not necessarily as important due to the fact that the host provided a great deal of insight to the location, and accessing it. The only issue I would say, is if you are disabled/in a wheelchair, I would not recommend this location because it is on the third floor, otherwise, everyone else could feel comfortable entering and leaving the location.

This apt was actually bigger & provided more amenities than a standard, regular size room in any hotel. It literally has a kitchen, a regular size fridge, stove, & oven. There's tons of dishes & silverware one is able to utilize. The TV offered Netflix, the AC in the window offered both AC & heat, & the bed had a very cozy bed foam which made for a good night's rest.

Nor for an emergency but bc the host was violating their properties contract by price gouging all their time shares to airbnb folks. <br/>Anyway, I booked this over a month ahead for myself and my mom. It was expensive, but it said superhost, so I thought it would be a small, cozy place but with all of the amenities listed, excellent communication, host on board and ready to resolve issues asap, welcoming details, stocked tp and multiple towels, working kitchen and electronics, etc...<br/>Nothing DRASTIC happened, but there were a series of small frustrations and then one big one. the communication was there, but not much follow up, zero urgency, and - well, you'll see. The first red flag was having to contact the host for checkin info. I guess it was an instant book bc there was never a greeting message to say ""hey thanks for booking i'll contact you with check in info by x"". The listing said the checkin info would appear 3 days prior to checkin, the airbnb email i got a week ahead said 48 hours. well day before check in (28 hours maybe?) and there was nothing, so i messaged the host who then said she waited 24 hours to send that. so i was like okay that's a bit inconsistent. however, the directions she sent were pretty thorough. i mentioned driving up there so it would have been nice of her to volunteer info about parking. there is street parking in front of the property, across the street, or around the right corner (headed north). there are no tow signs or restricted hours, just a couple reserved handicap spots. the next frustration were the keys. there are three keys, none labeled - again no volunteered info in check in message about which goes to what. one goes to the gate. btw another thing not mentioned, there are dogs on the property. i didn't see them, i don't mind dogs. but my mom is allergic and others might want to know this but it's not in the listing that i'm aware of. so we figured out the gate key. went into the backyard where the tenants were hanging out in inflatable pools. that's cool, it's a shared space! <br/>the stairways up to your room are VERY narrow. there's no way anyone with lots of or big luggage will get up there without a struggle or possibly breaking their neck. we had several bags. i knew it was on the second level but you do go up 3 narrow wooden flights of stairs, one of which has a dog gate, making it even narrower and it takes up half the bottom step - so watch yourself. we find the door (it's the one on the right) and it took about five minutes to open it because it's an old door. so we were frustrated about the keys already, then the door but had we been TOLD which key goes to what and maybe the door would stick, it wouldn't have felt like one thing after another. just a courteous heads up would've been cool. when we got the door open, it was tidy. it's a small space, i'd say an efficiency. there's a double bed. i can't say it was comfy but hey i knew it was a double. what makes it ""two rooms"" is an arched wall between bedroom and kitchen. there's a full kitchen. there was a lot of baking stuff but the tea/coffee were in canisters as opposed to individual packets, which is a surprise because of covid. honestly, it's cute and sweet but i think it's best for one person. i think any other food is stuff left over from past guests bc it's not organized or stuff you'd want to snack on or presented in a very, you know, host-y way. there was a bottle of wine tho which i'm sure was for guests but then i wasn't bc it still had a price tag on it. i was expecting at least some water in the fridge. there was a frozen water bottle in the freezer and a bag of ice. there was a binder of places to eat, which was helpful, the wifi info, check out info. i noticed there was only one full TP roll when i used the restroom. we were there all of 5 minutes before heading out. so we didn't get back until 8, which is when i noticed the tv didn't work. i turned it on, blank, tried different inputs, unplugged tv and apple tv. then it finally came on but the ""menu"" button that lets you go back would never work so any time we wanted to just READ about a show or change a show, i had to unplug the apple tv to get back to the menu. i worked on it for a half hour before texting and messaging devin through the app. i heard nothing for over an hour. that's the other thing, i think messaging should stay in the app, not a phone, but i got a faster responses through text. after nearly 90 minutes of trying to get this tv to work after a long day of driving and running around chicago, devin did text but said she wasn't home and gave a few suggestions, which didn't work and said she'd come by the place by 11am. i was frustrated at that point because i've never heard of a host being out of reach the day of a check in or not having a second person who could resolve the issue. so okay first night no tv. now, the other thing was, the refrigerator. i thought it was the ac that sounded like a motor boat, but at six am when i could not sleep and it was pretty",handicap,Negative

Her apartment is very clean. Our bedroom was a good size for my friend and I. And her current foster cat was a delight. <br/>For people wondering about accessibility, there are probably 8 or so steps in the back to get to the landing where the door is. Then there's the threshold to get into the door. Once inside,  the space is very open so I didn't have any problem getting my rollator to my room.

The kitchen was well stocked and we enjoyed making coffee and bagels in the moening. <br/>The location is a 10-min walk to the riverfront and Rainey Street. You're definitely in a suburban neighborhood though with a lot of nearby construction and homeless people that makes the walk a little involved but Ubers/Lyfts were easy enough to get around.

WeÃ¢?Âre clean freaks so itÃ¢?Âs a big deal, but with a crawling baby it was even more important.<br/>The location was great! Felt very private, even though it was a duplex. We happened to run into the neighbor outside a couple times and she was very sweet. It was really convenient to a nice HEB. Walking distance if you donÃ¢?Ât mind the hills.

300574,"Overall, Veronica was very kind and responsive. She came to show me how to fix some issues/challenges I was having with things like the AC or the door lock. These were easy to resolve. They also allowed me to leave bags there after checkout before leaving for the airport. I really appreciated all these efforts. <br/>My main concerns were:<br/>1)  There was a ton of construction materials (massive beams and large, hard-to-see steel and concrete footings) in front that I wasnÃ¢?Ât told about. These became an issue when I was returning to the property after dark and tripped, because it is hard to see and be aware of all the different things when in a new, unfamiliar space. <br/>2) Things needed attentionÃ¢?Â like one or two of the upstairs wires that serve as a railing were completely loose.<br/>This is this first somewhat negative review I have left. I left it after careful consideration, because a property MUST be safe. It will be when these issues are fixed.","stair, large",Neutral

Whole Foods coffee and blueberry scones on the counter, fridge stocked with variety of sparkling water and beer.  Washer/dryer available to use. Yoga mat to keep up with daily stretching. Loved the separate TV living room from bedroom since one of us likes to sleep with no TV.

The house has air conditioning, but we usually keep the blinds closed and use fans, which has worked both years we've visited. There is a washer and dryer on-site, too.

Couch is very dated, cushions completely collapse on the sofa and provide no support.  The upstairs bathroom, while large, needs to have the shower enclosed.  Water spills everywhere because the shower curtains are not long enough.  We sopped up water with towels and bath mat after every shower.  Also a lot of mold on curtain and in between the stone tiles. Internet wifi did not reach the upstairs bedroom at all.  And for a place that sleeps 10, to not have more than 3 wine glasses and a few other odd glasses seems odd (a quick trip to the dollar store would solve problem).

He also provided a location to store our luggage which was a HUGE help and we very much took advantage of it. The building itself is not pleasing to the eye whatsoever. As a group of girls on this trip, the inside of the building was a bit sketchy to say the least and not what we had expected. (Very scary feeling at night) Once we got to our unit however, it was EXACTLY what the photos showed. Plenty of space, nice and cool inside and plenty of rooms/beds/bathrooms for a large group. The beds and blankets were VERY high quality and comfortable.  However, the upstairs loft had some issues. The vents pointing directly to the beds were filled/covered with mold.

The yard was littered with leaves, cinderblocks, an AC unit, gardening supplies, and a shipping container. My dog cut his foot open while in the backyard, which was also littered with excrement, presumably from former guests' dogs that were never picked up.

5046776,"MilesÃ¢?Â place, Camp Congress, is the perfect place for large group stays, or small to medium-sized events. The space is a beautiful, tree-covered canopy right on the famous South Congress and easily walkable to many great restaurants, shopping, downtown, or the Austin bats.<br/>Inside, the 6 airstreams provide private, unique spaces for all your guests, and the air conditioners work great in them! ThereÃ¢?Âs still 4 more bedrooms inside the house, on-site laundry, two patios, a full kitchen, a bar setup, and more. The only real catch is that the kitchen is upstairs, so get your walking shoes on if you need to bring in a lot of food supplies as youÃ¢?Âll haul them up the stairs in the back or the beautiful, but small, spiral staircase inside the house.<br/>10/10, would recommend Camp Congress to any groups or events wanting to stay right in the heart of Austin.","stair, large",Negative

Sue took a lot of care to provide guests with a comfortable stay.  We would definitely rent again when back in town.<br/>One parting thought to share concerns the step in bathtub/shower combination.

Margaret provided a thorough orientation as well as an ample supply of breakfast items. The  place was attractive and quite clean. The bedroom and bathroom are roomy, and the living area with the mini-kitchen and laundry is big enough for two people. A quirk is that there's no kitchen sink, so you have to go down a few steps to the bedroom/bathroom area to wash any dishes. This was a great base for visiting our son and his family--we all really enjoyed supper at  Bar Peached downtown. Will be happy to stay there again.","step, big",Negative

Really there were only two issues that kept it from a perfect five: the first was that there was all this beautiful coffee and tea equipment but only a couple of worn out tea bags, no cream option and one old packet of stevia, which was a bit of a bummer, and the second was that there were supposed to be accessible streaming services on the TV in the living room and we had some issues getting the sound on the record player.  But in terms of the beauty of the property, the value for money, the location, and the beautiful pool, it was an exceptional stay. Thank you Bill!","accessible, tub",Neutral

There were some missing amenities that Megan noted after our departure (muffins and cold brew), but that wasnÃ¢?Ât a deal breaker. Megan provided plenty of complimentary water, which we used for coffee and to take with us. There is no true kitchenette or sink besides the bathroom, so cooking a full meal was out of the question. The AC is centralized to the house and not accessible from the room, so it did get a little toasty at times. The bed was super comfy! The area is relatively quiet for the most part, but the cats like to party all night. Megan was kind enough to let us leave our vehicle in the driveway on the day of checkout, which was really helpful considering our event lasted most of Sunday.

Guest bath sink water temperatures are backwards. Not a problem, but helpful to know<br/>2. Parking garage is a great value add. However, note that large cars will have a difficult time maneuvering. Normal-size cross-overs would be fine. Minivans are going to be tight. Large SUVs and the like may not be able to park safely there.<br/>3.

Nonetheless, when we ventured upstairs or outside, we encountered some disappointments. Many of the upstairs lights were out, and we found some hygiene issues like urine on the seats, dirty tub and sinks and we found a lot of hair in the bed. Additionally, the back door had significant rot, which extended to the outside deck. The outdoor area did not align with the photos provided; the furniture was in poor condition, and there was no outdoor table for dining. The property's grounds were not well-maintained, and given the price we paid, we believe the house could benefit from some renovation if people are paying 4k for 3 nights. <br/>On a side note, David did attempt to get the placed cleaned while we were there, but we already had cleaned the upstairs.","stair, tub",Neutral

You can only see the tip of the lake a few miles away. <br/>-Washer was unusable because of very bad smell. Refrigerator was not properly cleaned.

The host promised to send someone on the next day of arrival, but changed the words that he would walk me through how to troubleshoot over the phone, which made me to spend a couple of hours to configure modem/router connections.<br/>- A few steps in the stairway from lower deck to the unit are broken, and we felt unsafe.","stair, step",Neutral

The amazing windows are awesome for the view, but it made it incredibly hot in the house. Desperately need to have curtains or blinds on those windows to allow the house to cool down. The downstairs bathroom did not have any mats and the shower curtains poured all the water onto the floor, so it was a fall hazard. When I initially booked the house, all the pictures were different and not accurate. I know the water levels change, but the pictures that showed water access were at least a couple years old.

I know bugs can be an issue out in the country like this, but it was bad enough that our kids didnÃ¢?Ât want to utilize the bathroom downstairs forcing many people to share a single restroom.  <br/>Bedding was clean, but overall the house just felt really dated and dirty and is really in need of updates.  The larger room downstairs appears to be a converted garage space and the cooling wasnÃ¢?Ât great in there even though we had pretty moderate weather for the days we were there.  Improper wood is in use on the decks which can be felt by just how rickity everything feels and the curling of the boards and popping of nails.  Proper deck boards would prevent this issue.  <br/>The pool is nice, it isnÃ¢?Ât 8ft deep as the listing shows, maybe 5-5.5 ft max at any depth we found.

Anyway, I wouldn't recommend this as a stay for couples/friends who are not close as you essentially have to lock one couple in the bedroom to use the bathroom since its connected to the bedroom and living room. Moreover, if you're over 5'8 or plus sized using the upstairs loft and the stairs is not possible. Meaning the ceiling is low upstairs and the stairs are extremely narrow.

I think that Jason is a wonderful host and offers great communication. This condo is on the 4th floor which I didn't have a problem with, but one of our coworkers has an injured foot so the amount of stairs were a little challenging. Just a heads up for anyone who might not realize the amount of stairs. The area is a mixture of nicer refurbished buildings mixed with old run down and abandoned buildings. The convention center is a nice short walk but to get there you have to walk through the neighborhood that is not the safest feeling.

One thing to know is it can be a little noisy on the weekend nights as it's close/central to many attractions downtown, but that is a part of what made it the perfect place to stay, especially if you love to have walkable access to everything.

Didn't read between the lines about access to the first floor only (my bad).

Not a deal breaker because it's priced for what you pay for, but I give honest reviews so renters will not be surprised.  If you know what to expect, your stay will be relaxed.<br/>The pros to staying in a home lived in is much supplies.

Other problem we had was the actual house has strange layout and not very comfortable.  For that price I was not expecting that.  Maybe this is more of an event space and not a rental?  Two king beds side by side was strange.  Maybe summertime makes more sense and you are outside more.  Consider the wierd bed layout before booking if booking with couples.

I would be happy to live there forever! We are so grateful to yall! Thank you so much!","stair, spacious",Neutral
20587024,"Perfect location, 5 minute walk to Barton Springs.  Unit was very cute and spacious.  Backyard had a nice sitting area that we enjoyed.  Beds were very comfy and bathroom upstairs was large with modern updates. <br/>Overall we really enjoyed our stay, but there are a few downsides to the unit. The upstairs gets hot even though we had the thermostat set at 70.  (note, we went in the summer.)  If you close the bedroom doors, like we did, it didn't feel like the A/C was getting into the rooms.  Luckily floor and ceiling fans come with the unit which was helpful.   The unit is also a little too dark for my liking, although it does have some large windows in the living room and kitchen which brings in some light.","stair, large, spacious",Neutral
20641339,"Very good location for exploring Austin but felt  the condo building was not maintained and very tired and run down both inside the unit and outside. Mold going up the outside of the building, for instance. The way it looks gives one the feeling of a lack of cleanliness. The owner mentions it is their private residence but there were not any signs of personal belongings.  There is no railing to hold on to going up and down the interior stairs. No hot water in the bathroom sink which is electronically activated by hand motion and a large Ã¢?ÂthunkingÃ¢?Â noise each time you put hand under it.  We were there in winter so the upstairs was really hot and the downstairs would be cold. The furnace is in a bedroom closet. Even though the  shower  was wonderful and updated as were the kitchen appliances, it was hardly an updated and well, maintained condo. We expected more for the $680 for 2 nights. We have stayed in numerous ARBNB and VRBOs all over the world and have had much better experiences.","stair, large",Neutral

The apartment is right on the lake and has anything you might need for 2 people for a short stay. The bathroom is large and clean and the bedroom is also large and clean and comfortable with an extra fan for hot sleepers and an air purifier. Bedroom also faces the lake. There is a grille and a hot tub which we did not use nor did we access the lake. We attended a wedding at Hudson bend ranch which was 5 minutes away. The only negative thing I can even say about this place is that you do hear the water from upstairs - in the middle of the night even - IÃ¢?Âm assuming it is toilets flushing, water running, etc.  I would stay here again","stair, large, tub",Neutral

The sofa did not look like the one in the photos (as of Nov 2023), but it's actually larger.  They have an air mattress for downstairs if needed, but the couch worked just fine for sleeping as well (in addition to one guest in the loft bed).  The space is VERY private!  It's basically a tiny house and supply shed, and even though it's part of the main house's property, it's surrounded by it's own 6-foot fence that can be locked from the outside and the inside, so it felt very safe.  It was pretty clean except for some dust bunnies on the stairs.  Yard could also use some TLC.  Quick response when we needed some extra supplies.  We spent most of our in Downtown Austin, a quick Uber ride away (or long-ish walk).  Walkable to E. 6th St. bars & restaurants.  No TV but WiFi is good.  Would recommend.","stair, large",Neutral

She was super responsive and handled any issues promptly. She literally came and built a new bedframe for me because there was a problem with the bed, which was honestly really impressive. There is a laundry room right behind the building and it would have been perfect if there were a coin machine there however the nearest coin machine I found was actually at a laundromat about 5 mins away by car on Airport Blvd. The water for the shower heats up immediately and the air conditioner/heater works really good. The floorboards in the ceiling aren't insulated well so when the person upstairs walks around you can hear every footstep.

There are so many beautiful and thoughtful personal touches.

The pool was a bit smaller than we expected, but was sufficient for our group of 8. Also the pool water was cool which was nice in the Texas heat. The king bedroom was nice and spacious but the other two rooms were a bit cramped with too many beds. The reason for the 3 stars is mostly for the house rules which we felt was excessive. We got constant reminders all over the house to not do this or do that with the threats of getting kicked out if we broke certain rules, which obviously killed the vibe. We shared this feedback with the host and we hope he respects our opinion.","ramp, spacious",Neutral

We would definitely stay here again when visiting Austin in the future!<br/>My only complaint is that the apartment doesnÃ¢?Ât get a ton of natural lighting, which was a bit challenging when I was working from home during the days. I imagine it keeps the apartment cooler during the hot summer months though.","accessible, spacious, lighting",Neutral

Remember to use the sleeping pads in the upstairs walk in closet on the pull-out futon downstairs so you can avoid the spring mattress there; Rachel really thought of everything! The location is also basically perfect; it's far enough away from Lamar and West 6th that it's very quiet and easy to sleep at night, but close enough to those things that you can walk to Texas Chili Parlor, West 6th, Cloakroom, etc. in 15 minutes or less. In 30 minutes on foot you're across the Lamar pedestrian bridge to Barton Springs road and South Austin!

There was no hot water during our stay. The shower will only run at lukewarm temperatures.<br/>3. Mattress in the room was pretty worn out, felt like we were sinking into it.<br/>4. Upstairs neighbours were very loud and kept waking us up around 4-5am. Ceiling floors are paper thin.<br/>5.

Not too big to be a waste of space and not too small to feel cramped. Plenty of room to relax and sleep while still close enough to stay connected. Between the bunk beds and huge couches there were several options for the kids to spread out. <br/>We have family in the area so the location was perfect.

It was really humid and stormy during my trip but the central AC helped me feel comfortable at night. unfortunately some mosquitos got into the unit during my stay (likely when I opened the balcony to check out the thunderstorm) and I ended up with around 20 bites when I left bc I couldnÃ¢?Ât get rid of them no matter what I did. the host tried to help with some ideas and this was totally out of their control. I donÃ¢?Ât hold this against them and loved the unit. just mentioning this as I highly recommend bringing bug spray if you are someone mosquitos also love to love.

There was a store nearby which we were able to get quarters for the laundry. Would have been more convenient to have washer and dryer in the apartment.

A short walk away from great restaurants/bars or a quick Uber to downtown/South Congress Ave. Alex provided a great recommendations guide. <br/>However, the space felt cramped for our group of five. The living room lacked adequate seating (2-person coach and uncomfortable metal chairs), only 2 chairs outside on the deck. It would be very tight with all 9 beds filled.<br/>Coffee machine was missing. Host told me one would be delivered but it never came. No response after that. Front door lock was unreliable. Missing essential amenities like hand soap, extra trash bags, and dishwasher detergent which could have been pretty bad if we had more people. The shower drain cover was disgusting. We spotted a cockroach in the kitchen at one point as well.<br/>Overall I'd say that if you have a group of no more than 6 and plan to spend the large majority of your time away from the home this place can be a good pick simply for the great location.","ramp, large",Neutral
28606500,"Overall we enjoyed our stay, even with 8 people I wouldnÃ¢?Ât say it felt too cramped. Parking was easy and the location is great if youÃ¢?Âre going to the conference center. <br/>We did run into a few issues - the first night we got there is was raining and there was a leak in one of the bathroom ceilings which the host sent someone to fix. There also are not items like trash bags, youÃ¢?Âll need to buy those, and I didnÃ¢?Ât see any shampoo/body wash like the listing showed. In the photos it shows several chairs out on the deck but there was only one so we couldnÃ¢?Ât spend time out there as a group. <br/>For the price IÃ¢?Âd say this place is definitely worth it since buying some of the small missing things isnÃ¢?Ât a problem with the money you save. If you have a large group itÃ¢?Âs kind of summer camp vibes in the smaller area but overall it was a good location, price, and did the job. Thanks for having us!","ramp, large",Neutral

28640193,"This place is great! The hosts were extremely responsive and helpful. I felt very safe when sleeping, it was extremely clean and itÃ¢?Âs super cute! But, a few disclaimers, maybe sure youÃ¢?Âre ready to climb up that ladder to the bed, if you have to sleep double check you donÃ¢?Ât have to use the restroom and that you have everything up there. That comes with the territory so I donÃ¢?Ât mind it. Just something to keep in mind when booking. The step stool in the closet is really helpful for getting things up there. But if youÃ¢?Âre short like me you may have to stand on your tippy toes even with it. The hosts answered all my questions and when I forgot to book and extra night they were flexible and responsive. Very sweet as well. The only other complaint IÃ¢?Âd have is it is a long way to enter the airbnb, itÃ¢?Âs not the length thatÃ¢?Âs the issue but the rocks used on the ground make it hard to carry luggage into the area. I had a few large bags I had to carry instead of wheeling. So keep that in mind.","step, large",Negative

We had all the amenities we could possibly need and then some. The beds were extremely comfortable with soft bedding. I could see how this could get a little cramped for more than two people. Three would be fine for a brief stay. We do wish we had a full length mirror, but honestly, that is literally the only thing we were missing, as the hosts provided everything else. The shower was incredible and spacious. We did see one large roach in the shower but, the tiny house is surrounded by an adorable garden and greenhouse, so this was not surprising. The space was extremely clean and had the cutest decor. I would absolutely recommend this to anyone coming to visit austin!!","ramp, large, spacious",Neutral

Nice large room, great king bed, private bathroom and a large desk to work at. My last night in town I had a very good dinner at the Clay Pit , an Indian restaurant which is short walk. A little pricey but the food and atmosphere were good. Just watch the steps coming out of the restaurant. I almost had a fall , and I hadnÃ¢?Ât even been drinking.

After living there for a few days, it definitely lacks the homey feeling with its lack of art or decorations found in most homes and rentals.  Our family was comfortable and the home had plenty of space.  Not a complaint, however, if you have anyone with mobility issues, this house is not for you, due to steep inclined driveway, steps and no walk in showers.   <br/>My suggestions to make the stay more pleasant would be to provide a few standard necessities such as cleaning products to wipe down counters and tables with additional kitchen towels, extra garbage bags, extra toilet paper and paper towels. Jetted tub was nice touch, however the plug was broken and spout was coming off the wall. The beds were comfy and clean. Great house for several couples or sharing beds.  It would be nice to have one room with twin beds or if the sofa downstairs was a pull out for a variety of sleeping arrangements. Thank you.","stair, step, tub",Negative

Although it's not huge, it doesn't feel cramped, it's set up beautifully with the bed feeling like a cozy nook, space for a couch and dining table, and a great little kitchen. The bathroom is airy as well with nice light and a washer and dryer--incredible! Ashton and Charm could not have been more warm and welcoming. A chair broke while I was there and I felt so sorry and instead they apologized and wanted to give me a gift certificate to a local eatery--so kind. I didn't feel the need to take them up on it--things happen!--but just the level of kindness and hospitality-- next level.

It was easy to grab an Uber to wherever we wanted and the trips were pretty short, usually 10-15 minutes. The outdoor space was perfect and we spent time out there almost every day. The only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 was the noise from the upstairs apartment. Yikes. If you are a light sleeper and there are people staying above you, you will hear them. Pray they like to sleep in because we were unfortunate enough to have super early risers above us.

I had very few issues finding the place but maybe a light highlighting the address or painting the address in a lighter color so I don't have to get out and walk over to see if that's the right house might be good. One needs to be able to locate the place at night if they are arriving late.<br/>It was rather loud upstairs so just be forewarned that this unit is below another unit and since it's an older structure, you will hear every creak of wood and whoever was upstairs didn't try at all to be quiet, dropping things on occasion, playing music, whatever.

David also came over to try, but no dice. He arranged for someone to come the next day, but the person never came. Thankfully, we figured out a way to get the washer to work.

Also, the towels felt very used, and were tiny, which is always a little frustrating, but no different than what you'd get at any standard lower end hotel.<br/>Also, the bed felt VERY unstable. When we'd roll over at night, the whole bed shook, which was a little scary. That said, the bed was at least comfortable when it wasn't shaking from slight movements.<br/>All in, it was worth the price that was listed, and the area was a quiet one, there was a cute little welcome sign, a small assortment of granola bars and mini sodas, and best of all - checkout was super simple and hassle free, unlike a lot of airBNBs we've stayed in.","ramp, big",Neutral

Which, with the comparably high cleaning fee, left me frustrated. In addition, being asked for an extra $75 to clean a couple of plans and dishes was beyond surprising, the host said cleaning fees were for linen only, not anything else. which made sense why everything else was so dirty. if that wasn't enough, we had no hot water during our stay,  something I expressed the first night.","stair, ramp",Negative

A neighbor had let us in the elevator hallway so we were able to gain access to the unit however then we went to eat and again could not get in so we were waiting over a hour to get ahold of the host to get in. Theres a fab in apt which once we found we were ok.,elevator,Neutral
37905806,"The address to get to the building was correct, but the instructions on how to get inside it was a nightmare. There were 4 of us, not related, trying to find the apartment. <br/>There was never an explanation that in order to get to the apartment you needed to go inside another building NOT called Sonder nor that it was going inside via the garage to find the door. On top of it, across the street was a building named Sonder, but it was not the one we were looking for. In addition, there was NOT instructions of what the floor number was based on the apartment number. We were lucky to have a tenant coming out of the building elevator who told us that it was 4th floor!<br/>On the other hand, the apartment had a great location for restaurants and night life. The place had everything needed for spending a few days.",elevator,Neutral
37905806,"The unit was so clean and pristine. Loved it!<br/>The entire floor of an apartment building is for Sonder rental units. IÃ¢?Âve stayed with Sonder in another city and it was the same layout.<br/>We had an INCREDIBLY difficult time understanding which building it was because the address was different and listed the building across the street (which is where Sonder business office is). The downstairs elevator code wasnÃ¢?Ât working (the machine wasnÃ¢?Ât working) and so we were even more confused as to which building it was. It would have been helpful if instructions were more clear as to how to access the building and WHERE. Additionally, each unit had instructions on how to operate the lock to get inside- but ours happened to not. So we were pretty confused on how to turn the keypad on for several uses until we noticed there were instructions on other peoples doors.<br/>Besides the difficult check in/ access and finding the building, we had a great stay and would definitely recommend!","elevator, stair",Neutral

There was a door code to the pool that was never given and couldnÃ¢?Ât be found anywhere.  However, the space its self was great. Very clean very spacious even for 6!

The interior is clean, fully stocked, offered logins to multiple streaming platforms, fast wifi for remote work, top of the line W/D in unit, and has extremely well functioning air conditioners. The private patio is a few feet away and accessible with a key. Also mere minutes away from grocery stores and local restaurants.<br/>Our home was hit by Hurricane Beryl and lost power for a week. The hosts were very flexible with our last minute booking for my husband and I, as well as our two pets. The host was also very responsive before and during our stay.<br/>We loved it so much we stayed an extra day!<br/>Only cons were that the shower water wouldnÃ¢?Ât stay a consistent temperature, and we often heard noises from the attached residence when in the bedroom.<br/>9.9/10 experience, we will definitely be back soon.","stair, accessible",Neutral

Having two bedrooms and a kitchen was great, although if you plan to cook you'll need to bring all your own spices, oils, etc. However, there are lots of great restaurants and coffee shops within walking distance. The backyard space--easily accessible from the downstairs apartment--was nice for morning coffee in the shade and for visiting Petrie (the friendly pig). He obviously enjoyed getting his back scratched with the provided scratching implement! We were pleasantly surprised not to hear noise from South Congress, being so close, and the people upstairs were respectful and pretty quiet. Like many places we visited in Texas, Tide seems to be the preferred laundry detergent and the sheets carried the scent. It didn't bother my travelling companion, but it did me; you might mention to the host ahead of time if you have chemical sensitivities. All in all, a great stay!","stair, accessible",Neutral

Everything was clean spacious and comfy. Hunter was very communicative and we had no issues.<br/>I also loved the way that it's like a hotel when you check out.

I loved soaking in the bright upstairs space.  I love spiral staircases and enjoyed the one in the space but do have mobility issues and realized it was probably not very practical if I needed to use the toilet downstairs during the night.  So I would keep that in mind for someone that has any ambulation issues.  But there is the bed downstairs which worked great.  The bird calls were beautiful in the morning.  I would definitely stay again.","stair, tub",Negative

39974185,Nice stay and the photos are accurate. I see opportunities for improvement to this listing .<br/>One - update to the stairs to the loft. I think the stairs to the loft are very hard to use. I was not comfortable getting up and down and couldn't bring up my night supplies to that height because I was worried of falling without using both hands. I think this place is worth it if your up for using this kind of stairs.<br/>Two - The house could use a back up filter and instruction manual for the hot tub. I think there could have been a little more expectation setting around the hot tub. It is inflatable which was fine. Unfortunately I wasn't able to use the hot tub for two reasons.  A)  a error message relating to a filter (E02) though water did look clean. And host was able to help diagnose.

My parents were staying in a hotel downtown and it was easy to get to and from them, plus having a parking spot for the rental car was so helpful, especially since that's getting harder and harder to find these days!  After my parents left town, it was easy to walk to different restaurants to meet with friends, which was so nice.  There is a steep staircase and a stone path to get to the spot, which was fine for me but tricky for my step-dad who's a stroke survivor, but the railing made it safe - just want to point out.

I think Ganesh was aware of the leak problem, but didn't communicate the scale of it properly so that I could make another plans. I had to dry up the apartment because I didn't have time to fight for a refund. There were only a few sheets left on the only toilet paper.

After registering the car  they will ask you to pay $25 x all days you will stay without even asking if the parking is needed for every single day. They need to fix that. Austin is very hot, so it was nice to be able to manage the AC. I have no idea why they call Austin the capital of live music. 6th AVE is full of DJs, homeless, and huge clubs lines filled with kids. Off 6th ave there are a couple of jazz clubs. Music starts after 7 or 8pm, nothing earlier, only instrumental, no vocals. Cities like Nashville are way ahead in the music scene.  I found in my experience, that many people in TX are kind of rigid, tend to complicate things while hoping for sophistication. There is a terrible smell on the first floor where elevator is.","elevator, step",Neutral

It does not have voice to text just arrow direction buttons that take forever to click it makes you frustrated. Last a few complementary items would be nice. Maybe a few bottles of water and a small snack or something. Because the place is located in the city not many ""real grocery stores"" around.

It was fine but you are probably paying a premium for such a nice house in this neighborhood.  <br/>Heat was a big problem. It was very hot inside when we arrived and never got comfortable during the 2 day stay. We came from Houston so well aware of the Texas heat in August. There are 3 huge windows in the living room (with great views) that have no covering. It never got below 85 in the upstairs living room. Upstairs was almost unusable. A technician came the 2nd evening and didn't do much.  Said the system was low on freon.

There is more than enough space to park a large lifted truck and I was able to have a second vehicle on the street without incident. It is a mixed use neighborhood and while some may feel unsafe as itÃ¢?Âs not the suburbs, I was totally comfortable walking my dog at night (IÃ¢?Âm used to the neighborhood as I live in a similar spot). The condo was exactly what it looked like in photos, super cute! It is a queen bed but very comfortable. Plenty of extra linens and the front room has a pullout couch, and is also a perfect spot to sit and read! I loved the open concept of the living and kitchen areas. Plenty of gadgets and cookware for simple meals and the nespresso coffeemaker is a huge plus! The place smells amazing! The only noises noticed were from the upstairs folks, but not terrible. Highly recommend!","stair, large",Neutral
50509294,"Good- Apt interior is cute and a good space for 2-3 ppl. Neighborhood was so-so but relatively quiet and no obvious safety issues. Kitchen is well stocked with utensils, pans, seasoning etc. Master has a good size walk in closet. Parking always available. There's 1 Mini Mart about 4 blks away and many things within 5-10 min drive. Host is responsive. Easy check in/entry.<br/>Bad-HOWEVER, there is a notable COCKROACH problem. Pest Control came on the 10th day and it slowed them down but did not eradicate the problem. There was at least one roach spotted per day (in a 1 month stay) and in every single room. For this reason alone I will not return. <br/>FYI's- if these are important to you: Every step/action your neighbors take can be heard. <br/>One of the neighbors often has his dog off leash. <br/>It's on the 1st level but on top of the parking spaces so there are stairs. <br/>There is no dining room table/area, and zero chairs in general.","stair, step",Negative

A couple of things folks should know:<br/>1. There are no blinds except in one of the smaller roomsÃ¢?ÂÃ¢?Âonly sheer curtains. If you are not used to sleeping with a lot of light, maybe stay elsewhere. <br/>2. The fan/lights in the two small bedrooms respond to each other's remotes. This made it very hard to make sure the kiddo's overhead stayed off while using the other room. (The only lamp didn't work.)<br/>3. The pool situation wasn't ideal; vacuum full of leaves and many more in the pool. Also, because part of the patio is large gravel, many pieces had gotten into the pool as well, which (we found when we eventually got into the pool) was a rather painful surprise every few steps. Bailey tried to call her pool guy, but because of the eclipse no one came to clean it. I ended up cleaning the vacuum/pool myself.<br/>Otherwise we had a great time!","step, large",Neutral

I couldn't reach the host or leasing office, but a resident helped me find a back staircase.<br/>Upon arrival, I noticed cleanliness and maintenance issues:<br/>- The floor had crumbs and debris, and there were cobwebs on the kitchen light fixtures.<br/>- The shower had a hole in the wall, hot water lasted less than 10 minutes, the tub drained slowly, and the shower head was overly pressurized.<br/>I reported these issues on the first day, but no action was taken. Despite these problems, the location is excellent, within walking distance to East Austin. They also included a nice bathroom kit with toiletries which was appreciated.

The driveway is the only struggle with this house but if you go slow and have patience it will be fine. The Airbnb is close to everything. All of the places we wanted to go to were less than 20 minutes away which was very nice.

We had no problems with street parking. The beds are super comfy and the towels and linens are nice quality and seem very clean. Decor is unique. For a place that could sleep ~9 the indoor hang out space is very limited and the kitchen is small.  There is a large outdoor space and table however.

Only 5 people (1 toddler) stayed in the home & we felt like we had more than enough space. & it was pretty toddler proof as well! But I will say we werenÃ¢?Ât completely satisfied with the cleanliness of the space. The upstairs bathroom, specifically the bathtub, was not the cleanest. There was an odor coming from the left sink in the kitchen so we didnÃ¢?Ât really use it unless we needed to quickly wash something. The microwave needed a quick wipe down on the inside. I used 2 towels that were provided & I found hair. I had to kill at least 3 bugs in the home as well. I would give this place between 4-5 stars since theyÃ¢?Âre all easy fixes.

However, Shannon was very responsive and helpful in solving the issue. <br/>Just to note that the second bedroom is not suitable for anybody with any kind of impaired mobility, young children or the elderly due to the steep loft ladder that leads to the room.

The bath looks like a big hit with most of the guests but being shower people we found it a bit awkward with the shower curtain a bit close and water going over the sides if you werenÃ¢?Ât careful. Not ideal for an older guest either as the sides are high and its slippery underfoot. Location is good and easy to find but the neighborhood was a little disappointing with many of the yards unkempt and untidy with junk left in the front yards. However it was quiet and that was nice.

The pool table had a hole in the pocket and only one useable pool stick. The owners did Amazon some tips to us the next day. There was wiring exposed, it was capped but still accessible. The exterior door frames are rotted out, the rocks were full of weeds, flex conduit coming out of the driveway was unsafe when trying to walk to your cars. There was no where to hang bath towels in the master bathroom. Under the beds was disgusting and hadnÃ¢?Ât been touched and the master shower had a horrible smell.

However the room with the bunk beds and the small room downstairs can be really improved. Bunk beds was so squeaky I felt like it will break if I even moved slightly. The room downstairs has a sofa bed that was covered with an extremely dirty sheet and it was not suitable for sleeping at all. I will recommend updating the bedding situation in those two rooms for improved guest experience.

All of the bedrooms are spacious and far apart offering privacy. There's lots of closet space and luxurious bathrooms for all. The house is well stocked with everything you could possibly need. The 10 person jacuzzi tub, gas grill and covered seating areas outside are heavenly. The location can't be beat, it's close to downtown attractions, some within walking distance.

His shaded yet open yard, relaxing pool, trampoline, porch swing, and outside deck were all perfect for our family to enjoy the summer.  The only drawback is Westlake Dr gets a bit busy at rush hours, but during the day and at night it is quiet.  The neighbor on one side is a wooded city lot, and the other is a neighbor that you can't really see, so the setting overall makes you feel like you're in a private, quiet, rural setting, even though you're just a few minutes from downtown and pretty much everything.  <br/>We would highly recommend David and his home to anyone.",ramp,Neutral
53670109,"My recent stay at Ira's Airbnb offered a blend of comfort and convenience, nestled in a prime location close to major freeways, a plethora of shopping and dining options, and just a brief car ride from the vibrant downtown area. The Airbnb itself provided a serene and inviting atmosphere, though it could benefit from additional personalization to enhance its homely feel. A significant drawback was the non-functional elevator, necessitating carrying luggage up to the 4th floor, which was quite cumbersome. Communication with Ira was overall satisfactory, though sometimes it felt a bit terse, likely a result of the limitations of text messaging. Despite these minor issues, the Airbnb's strategic location and the array of amenities it offers make it a commendable choice for travelers seeking both comfort and convenience.

The laundry room is in the garage below, and is easily accessible. Mark and his wife live in the adjoining house, which is located in a quiet, residential neighborhood. We spoke with Mark on the day we arrived. He was very personable and eager to please. Manor Road is just a couple of blocks away, where you will find some very good restaurants, and a couple of food trucks. I could hear noise from the highway. But it didn't bother my wife at all.

The house was clean, but definitely needs some deep-cleaning measures to make it feel more comfortable. It felt as if it had been cleaned after the last guests who stayed, but that it may have been a while in between guests so some things got a little more dusty and overlooked.<br/>There was an issue with the upstairs toilet when I first arrived. The owner was very quick to address it. The neighbor came over and attached the chain to the flusher and then it worked...it just ""ran"" all the time with a light water sound. <br/>We stayed over Christmas and the neighbors next door were having parties and setting off very loud (jump-scare) fireworks late into the night on both Christmas Eve and Christmas.

I asked to confirm several times, and they did. When I arrived, there was no such thing. At first they were dismissive, then realized the error and stepped up to compensate for the miscommunication. The place is managed by a management company with several different people answering messages, so it could be easy for the communication to be bad. There was a fold out bed, but it was dirty and had no sheets or pillows provided. They did end up bringing some. The other problem was that on the first morning we were there, they had booked a crew to remove a tree next to and over the house. We woke to people on the roof, limbs falling on the roof, chainsaws, and lots of debris falling over the entryway door. It was loud and disruptive and they seemed completely unconcerned.

The rugs in the unit were clearly dirty and soiled with stains, to the point that we did not feel comfortable walking barefoot on them. The elevators took forever to come to the 1st floor (there was always a line waiting) and there was no a/c in the elevators, which made the ride up and down almost unbearable.<br/>The hosting company was very communicative and apologetic for the state of the unit, but the pictures on the listing did not agree with its current state.

The listing is managed by a corporate rental co, and that was very much felt with the impersonal and automated communication and their outsourcing of what they refer to as ""concierge"". After calling and messaging me multiple times asking for an ETA, we felt pressured/rushed by them to meet up to hand over the key fob to us so they could leave.

Behind a coded gate and coded entry door, so felt pretty at ease at night; it is functionally on the second story so there are a quite a few stairs to go up before you're in the living area. Neighborhood was great, easy to get to South Austin locations like ABGB, Pinthouse Pizza Lamar, Black Sheep Lodge, etc. Everything was pretty quiet, lots of large mature trees surrounding the area; the loudest neighbor was a bird that decided to sing each morning in. Didn't really have time to try out the sauna, but that and the hot tub are tucked away in a private area behind the casita. Was comfortable for a quick stay in Austin, it's a nice functional space and is perfect for a traveling office or a couple getting away for an Austin trip.","stair, large, tub",Neutral

You wouldn't notice it at night, but might be shocked to see it in the daylight. As a woman I felt very exposed and so I showered in the dark.

There was very limited toilet paper with 9 guests. Paul had to come by with more. There was also a miscommunication about the codes to park and get into the building.

We liked that there were a lot of Airbnb guests in the building, so we didnÃ¢?Ât feel like a bother and there were a lot of interesting conversations in the lobby/elevator. The building seems built well though, as we never heard other guests. <br/>We felt safer during our stay due to the fact that you canÃ¢?Ât get up the elevator without a fob (two are provided).

The apartment complex is large - expect to walk a bit. There is an elevator which is fantastic. The top floor apartment has amazing views, and it's very quiet. Other neighbors I ran into were very friendly. Be sure to follow the instructions the hosts give for check-in -- it's very easy if you follow it! Bed is very comfortable; apartment was extremely clean. There's everything you could need, and then some. The large Brita container with filtered water ready was so appreciated! Wifi worked great. If you're bringing a dog, just be aware there's not a lot of grassy space for walks - be ready for a city dog experience! :) Both my pets were perfectly comfortable and safe the whole time.

The master bed was comfortable and the kitchen was fully stocked. <br/>However, there was lots of hair around the bath tub in the master bath, some mildew/mold on the water knob for the shower and the half bath downstairs looked as if it didnÃ¢?Ât get cleaned before we came. Most of this I can ignore and wipe down/ sweep up myself, which is what I did. I am a super clean freak so things that bother me may not bother others.

Quiet and safe community with many restaurants and stores near. The place was clean and comfortable and accommodated for all 8 of us. Perfect for a large family. The only thing I would say to consider is that there are many rules (and fees for breaking those rules), one of which is no shoes inside the duplex or you could inquire a $100 fee. I did feel like we were walking on eggshells trying to make sure not to break those rules, especially since we had two children and my disabled father who requires a walker. I would say itÃ¢?Âs a great spot for those traveling without children or individuals with assistive devices. Bonnie did respond in a timely manner and helped me find extra towels when we needed them and checked in on us daily.","disabled, large",Negative

It is a large place with expansive views and lots of unique spaces to sit, ponder, talk, imagine.

It might be an issue for those who have trouble raising their legs to get in and out, but there is clear wall space next to the tub to help brace yourself if this is an issue for you.

The bed was very comfy and there were plenty of pillows. Would consider staying again if the price was a bit more reasonable.

We reached out to Ignacio to cancel the remainder of our trip. He refused to refund, even though it was a health and safety issue. We got AirBNB involved and they were unable to help. Since we had not way to rebook somewhere else the remaining members of our family stayed. During that time we noticed the stair tread on the top step was loose and had screws sticking out of it, there were exposed light bulbs in the bathroom, mold in the corners of several rooms and the air intake, holes between walls and floors. And on the next to last day before we checked out (early at our own cost), one of our family members came up the back stairs and the step collapsed causing him to fall backwards down the steps and hit his head.

728281111865113623,The 3 Kings AirBnB is a beautiful house by any standard.  We used his house to host our families and friends flying in from out of state coming to our wedding at Vintage Villas which is a easy 6 minute drive to from this house.  The feeling you get when you walk into the house is one of safety and comfort.  We barely noticed a thunderstorm raging outside once we entered the house.  The biggest selling point for the house was that it was one of the few lakeway houses that offerred a ground floor master bedroom.  This was perfect for our elderly in-laws so that they wouldn't have to navigate stairs.  They loved the spacious master suite and luxurious bathroom.  They were comfortable and slept well while the rest of the guests enjoyed the game room upstairs. The kitchen had everything we needed and our guests loved every part of the house.

Only bummer is the second bedroom isn't in any of the photos advertised and the bathroom connects the two rooms. Also, one elevator was out of service after someone got stuck in it during our stay, leaving us waiting 5-10 minutes sometimes to get down from the 13th floor. Would consider staying again, but maybe a different room on a lower floor :)",elevator,Neutral

It was a Saturday evening I believe and everyone pretty much just told us there is nothing they could do until Monday. So we had to stay in this room for how many more days because there was nothing anyone could do because they could not get ahold of the owner of the unit. Beware- if you stay here and have ANY issues do not expect them to be solved during your stay. 2nd- The elevators are awful! We went with a group of 20 people and you canÃ¢?Ât get to anyone elseÃ¢?Âs floors with your room key- also to mention the keys only worked half of the time to get us to our own floor.

The location was excellence for easy access to Rainey Street and a quick Uber to the fun on 6th Ave.  We had a few challenges with the use of the keys and the elevators but the host was quick with communicating.  I would say the only downside of our stay was the lack of communication for Early check-in and Late check-out.  It's often difficult to coordinate all the moving pieces but we were told there was a chance for both and then told within hours that it was no longer a possibility.  It would be nice to have more time to plan accordingly.  Additionally, we also had trouble with Valet and was charged twice; still working on that at the moment.

There were only a few downsides- one was that there were no full length mirrors (we were there for a bachelorette and a full length mirror wouldÃ¢?Âve been nice) the other that the elevators were slow. It seemed like they only had 2 of the 4 working, so there was often a line to get on and we would have to wait for different cars going down because they were already full. <br/>There is also lots of construction going on around, not a deterrent to us, but good info to have. <br/>The location itself is superb. 5 minute ride just about anywhere and even walkable to Rainey street and other nearby spots. <br/>I do feel it was a little pricey- especially since parking is not included and limited to $40 a day valet or $30 a day street parking. <br/>Given all that, I would still recommend it and would absolutely stay again!",elevator,Neutral

As a result, we were reluctant to spend much time in the common living areas. We notified Francis, and actions taken were (1) property manager added air fresheners, which unfortunately didn't address the root cause, (2) plumber stopped by and determined repair work needed to be done.

One day we helped a lady holding her dog and a dog crate walk down 17 flights of stairs (due to waiting a crazy amount of time for the elevator to finally stop and repeatedly be full).

The tubs paint was also pealing along with the caulking and the walls had hair. To add, the bottom of the cloth shower curtain was stained yellow.

This was to be expected with all the windows and the Austin area being under an Excessive Heat Warning while we were there. As soon as the sun went down the temp would drop and we slept very comfortably. The kitchen was great and had everything we needed. One thing to note here, there is not a full size oven.

In the kitchen they even had an accessible drawer for the children which had shatter proof essentials like cups, plates, bowls, the children felt right at home being able to grab what they needed. We stayed for a little over a week and appreciated the amount of storage space for our items, a dedicated pantry space in the kitchen offered plenty of space for groceries and dressers in each room for storing clothes.

When we come back to Austin for a football weekend or get together this will be our first choice !!!","stair, spacious",Negative
930076351166284235,"I had a great experience staying here! I was lookign for a place walking distance to ACL as UberÃ¢?Âs are challenging, especially at night. This was the spot. ItÃ¢?Âs a little over a 30 minute walk back, not an easy walk but comparable to what youÃ¢?Âd walk to get an Uber anyway. The space itself was very open and spacious, actually bigger than I expected. There is a nice sized patio, plenty of living space and spacious bedrooms and bathrooms. It had easy access to Bennu downstairs, a 24/7 coffee shop. The instructions were clear getting in. <br/>The only negatives were that the host was right, the noise does need to be very minimum as the walls are very thin. So be mindful after 10, inside voices. Also, the cost was a little high for a maximum of 4 people in the space but I understand noise could be a problem with more.","stair, spacious, big",Neutral

Two bedrooms (three beds) and two bath is pretty rare, and the space was very nice and clean, despite missing a few things like coffee filters and basic seasonings.<br/>The reason I rate it a four not a five is that the communication was excessive (probably 10+ reminder messages over three days), they added checkout tasks not listed in the posting, and the building itself was kind of trashy (literally cloths on the ground in and around the elevator every single day). The rules seemed very strict to the point where my friend and I felt uncertain whether or not we could have a normal conversation after 10 pm without getting charged a $1,000 fine. Yes, $1,000. We did go to the rooftop area which was nice and mostly unused, but unfortunately the pool didnÃ¢?Ât seem to be cleaned daily (we did notice it being clean on our fourth/last day). <br/>I would stay here again, but cautiously.",elevator,Neutral

There is a balcony that wraps around the unit, just made sure all the windows were locked.  Plenty of parking available close to the unit. The neighborhood was quiet. We came to Austin to take a state required test the next day at 8am. My only complaint was the noise coming from the unit above us, there was a child running back and forth until at least 1:45 am maybe even later then that. I did read the reviews and only one previous review mentioned the upstairs noise, so I figured we'd give it a try since it was just one night stay only.

The downstairs bedroomÃ¢?Âs sliding door fell off the loose tracks (safety hazard). It was very heavy trying to hold it up while shouting for someone to help me. The home had other great amenities, though, like a large washer and dryer and handheld clothes steamer; additional parking in the rear; and good air conditioning. Overall, the listing is very nice as far as aesthetics. 4 stars because the issues are easily fixable.","stair, large",Negative
955833527387385803,"This was perfect for our needs.  We had a great stay that exceeded our expectations.  The pictures looked good, but the place is even better.  We thought the property was fairly priced, in a great location, and had unique architecture and style to set it apart from so many cookie cutter rentals. This trip was adults only, and it was perfect for three couples and a single to catch up and hang out in-between going out in Austin.  The great room/dining room made for an ideal common area with ample seating and a large gas fireplace surrounded by windows with wooded views.  We don't usually stay at the same rental more than once, but I suspect we'll be back to this one.  <br/>Other notes: <br/>I wouldn't suggest going down the VERY steep driveway without an SUV or something with a little clearance, but there is also some parking up top and our cars did fine.<br/>The place is VERY heavy on stairs and elevation changes.

BoÃ¢?Âs selection of books was fun to look through.<br/>I will absolutely check to see if this space is available when IÃ¢?Âm heading to Austin with friends next time.<br/>To be noted, the driveway is no joke. We rented a Suburban, due to our large travel party, and held our collective breath each time we parked. It was very tight! But you also donÃ¢?Ât want something low to the ground, because the down slope driving in is quite steep. Go for the Goldilocks option and get a midsize vehicle, if you rent something.<br/>Last thing, there are a lot of stairs throughout the house, so anyone with a mobility issue should take this into consideration.<br/>Cheers and hope to stay on this location again!","stair, large, spacious",Neutral

It's not a walkable location when it comes to restaurants & what-not; but the privacy is a perk for sure. The apartment is larger than the photos convey, lots of room to spread out with an open concept kitchen. Also, nice large tubs if you like to take baths. The apartment isn't super-host appointed, but we had almost everything we needed. The value for the price was definitely fair.

Getting out of the car you get hit with the smell of the juniper trees on the property. It's very well shaded and fairly private considering it's in a residential area. When Lake Travis is not in drought there's a boat dock nearby. <br/>There's a screened in porch with rocking chairs and a big swinging bed pallet that was great for naps. In the evening we turned on the patio string lights and took advantage of the swim tub, which you access via limestone steps and is behind a privacy screen. <br/>The cabin itself is extremely charming and spacious.

We had a good stay. <br/>However, there were too many issues with the house to make this a place I would recommend. For example, there were carpet nails poking out in one of the bedrooms that someone stepped on, the garbage disposal was broken the duration of the stay, in addition to many small issues like loose faucet handles. We needed to follow up with the management company to resolve the essential and safety-related issues which took time and effort during a short vacation. The company did send out the needed repair people when asked. Given the high price charged, it is inexcusable for the management company not to proactively take better care of the house and have it ready for a family, especially one of all ages. It does not feel like this house has a Ã¢?ÂhostÃ¢?Â and, as a result, there seems to be a lack of care that goes into this home to the detriment of its guests.","step, large",Neutral

The host accommodated by allowing me extra time to check out so I could take my time taking items up and down the steps. I recommended they add no elevator access to the description because this would be important for someone with physical injuries or disabilities.

Also was a little too easy to hear other hotel guests (kids) running around the hallways. Charging outlets could stand to be in more accessible locations (like the nightstand) and the room lighting was designed for mood/aesthetic moreso than visibilityÃ¢?Âwould be great to have an option for clearer lighting.

No communication between the hotel, Airbnb app and us made check in very stressful, time consuming, and forced a change in plans. <br/>Parking was rather expensive: $50+ per day valet was the only option for parking and the valets were so busy they didnÃ¢?Ât appreciate getting the car more than once. <br/>One of the two elevators did not work, and there was no signage indicating out of order, so travel around the building was slow and difficult. <br/>The pool was dirty but the space was beautiful. <br/>Wish we could give it a better review.",elevator,Neutral

Check-in was extremely easy, instructions were clear and so was checkout. Only negatives would be the club/bar across the street plays music very loudly at night, which doesn't really affect the bedrooms, just the living area. So be prepared for that. And the parking spots are very unclear, there are only 4 marked visitor spots, but there are a lot of unmarked/unreserved spots. Was unclear if we could park in unmarked spots, so once the 4 visitor ones were taken, we had to park on the street and pay.

We also loved how spacious this Airbnb is, with two large bedrooms as well as a full kitchen and a living room, as well as laundry facilities. There were a few things to watch out for, though. The entry into this 3rd floor unit is via a narrow, open-step wrought iron staircase in a dingy, dark hallway. The light in this hallway did not work, so we had to climb up the steps in the dark. There is a second light at the top of the steps that is accessible from inside the Airbnb, and once we got inside, we left that light on so that we could always have some light in the hallway. This unit provides cleaning supplies and kitchen supplies, but not as many bathroom supplies. For instance, there was no hand soap to wash your hands.","stair, step, accessible, large, spacious",Negative

1141396484351505605,"The staff was extremely kind and the apartment was beautiful! The check in process was not the best because so many people had delayed check ins due to a high turnover the night before. The front desk staff was very nice and did all that they could. Inside the room was very nice and clean, my only issues with the apartment was the upstairs bedroom became very hot due to the fan not working in room 129. The other issue was the WiFi was very slow or didnÃ¢?Ât work at some times. Overall though, I would probably stay here again especially if some of those kinks were worked out. The apartment itself was beautiful and spacious, the location was the perfect walking distance from activities, and the staff was extremely welcoming and kind.","stair, spacious",Neutral

Cute place<br/>Cons: you might save money for the location but parking is something else youÃ¢?Âll have to figure out on your own. The fob for either of the elevators didnÃ¢?Ât work and we had trouble using it to unlock the doors to get in on the side when we couldÃ¢?Âve just used the front entrance; we had to rely on the tenants to use their fob for elevator use.  We got in late and needed assistance but the host didnÃ¢?Ât answer. There was a coffee machine but no pods to use it. The shower wasnÃ¢?Ât super clean and there was only old spice for body wash (Im a woman who doesnÃ¢?Ât want to smell masculine). The couch has stains (as pictured).

Only issue we had was the patio fans did not seem to work. The 3rd bedroom wasn't much of an issue, but it is a separate studio on the second floor that could only be accessed from the outside staircase.

We walked around barefoot and our feet would be black.  In the bathtubs found toenail clippings not mine.  Lots of random hair that was not our was everywhere and dusty.  Queen sized bed was a bit hard & seemed small in comparison to the room.  Dishwasher didn't work.   There is also a up stairs neighbor who will stomp back and forth if you are too loud.  In the evenings large roaches would come out to greet us.  There is construction going on next door and there are only these white curtains that hang from the patio and if not adjusted properly you can just see right on through.

Big windows & huge deck to view the lake below! <br/>Lake access notes: <br/>We couldnÃ¢?Ât find shaded parking at either of the lake spots, but we had a great time chilling on our floats in the water. <br/>Option 1) About a 3 min drive through the neighborhood, then park & walk down about 150 steep steps. Our reward was access to a shaded dock thatÃ¢?Âs only for a few neighbors. No one was there while we were on a Fri afternoon/evening. <br/>Option 2) Approx a 10 min drive to the HOA park. You can drop off your stuff and park up the street (about a 5-7 min walk from parking). Nice shade & sun, grass, picnic tables, and a sand volleyball court.

Granted I booked this airbnb last minute, there were no basic necessities; no hand soap, drinking water, and the shower needs maintenance. Along with the shower, the bathtub needed some scrubbing. The airbnb is close to the elevator so you can hear people coming and going, and you can hear the people above you walking around (not the hostÃ¢?Âs fault at all!.) The parking is also terrible. It seems as if there is no designated parking for this place, so we had to find parking across the street and hope our car did not get towed.

Loved using the bucees blanket and enjoyed sitting on the porch people watching a bit. The main downside was how the elevator only worked a few times while staying there so it really sucked going up and down 2/3 flights of stairs multiple times.

There are plenty of dishes, silverware, pots and pans, potholders, knives, but not much else.  The appliances are all there and coffee as well.  Even though the housing development was in far south Austin, there were plenty of nice places to eat nearby.<br/>My only complaint was the over abundance of texts and emails, no parties, no loud noises... only a couple cars, no extra people....

Felt very safe - although it was at the top of a steep hill, the surrounding neighborhood was great for walking our dogs.  We had a small issue with the AC the night we checked in, Flor made sure someone brought over portable AC units for the night & repair man was there first thing in the morning. <br/>Some of the fences with the neighbors were falling down a bit and the patios had some wood rot that were a bit unsafe - we moved the small outdoor decorative tables on top of them to prevent anyone from stepping in the soft spots.<br/>Overall, a very enjoyable stay - thank you Flor!","step, large",Neutral
